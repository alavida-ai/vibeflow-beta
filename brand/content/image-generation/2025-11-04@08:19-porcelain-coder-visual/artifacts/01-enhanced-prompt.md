# Enhanced Prompt: Porcelain Coder Visual

## Original Request
"a man with a cap coding away on a retro computer, the man is a porcelain figure"

## Framework Analysis

### 1. Subject (What the image is about)
**User:** man with a cap, porcelain figure
**Enhanced:** A porcelain-textured man wearing a cap, sitting upright, engaged in focused coding work

### 2. Context (Where and how the subject exists)
**User:** coding away on a retro computer
**Enhanced:** At a desk with a vintage computer setup (CRT monitor, mechanical keyboard), warm interior environment, focused posture suggesting deep work

### 3. Style (How the image should look)
**User:** implied minimalist, clean
**Enhanced:** 3D ceramic/porcelain aesthetic with realistic material texture, retro-futurism vibe, warm ambient lighting, editorial product photography style

## Technical Specifications

**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (social media, balanced composition)
**Medium:** 3D render with photorealistic porcelain texture
**Lighting:** Warm ambient + subtle key light from screen glow
**Composition:** Rule of thirds, figure slightly off-center, desk in foreground
**Color Palette:** Warm neutrals (cream, beige, gold), screen blue accent, wooden/metal desk elements

## Refined Prompt

**Full Prompt:**
> A porcelain ceramic figure of a man wearing a vintage baseball cap, seated at a desk with a retro computer setup, coding intently on a mechanical keyboard. The man has a smooth porcelain-white texture with subtle glaze. The desk features a CRT monitor with warm glow, wooden surface, and vintage accessories. Warm ambient lighting from above creates soft shadows on the porcelain figure. 3D render style, photorealistic ceramic material texture, editorial product photography aesthetic, warm color grading, rich depth of field.

**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1
**Output Format:** PNG

## Prompt Engineering Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "porcelain ceramic figure" | Concrete noun replacing vague "is a porcelain figure" |
| "vintage baseball cap" | Specificity adds visual clarity |
| "retro computer setup" | Defines the tech era visually |
| "mechanical keyboard" | Details enhance retro authenticity |
| "smooth porcelain-white texture with subtle glaze" | Material specification for consistency |
| "CRT monitor with warm glow" | Specific retro tech element |
| "3D render style" | Medium specification for consistency |
| "photorealistic ceramic material texture" | Ensures porcelain look is accurate |
| "editorial product photography aesthetic" | Frames as high-quality showcase image |

## Expected Output

- Clear, recognizable porcelain figure (not abstract or symbolic)
- Authentic retro computer aesthetic (recognizable vintage tech)
- Professional composition with good depth and lighting
- Warm, inviting mood that showcases the figure as a collectible

## Iteration Strategy

If initial draft needs refinement, change ONE element:
1. **Subject refinement:** Adjust figure details (pose, cap style, facial features)
2. **Context refinement:** Adjust desk setup, computer style, or environment
3. **Style refinement:** Adjust lighting, material texture, or artistic approach
