# Assumptions

This is a file which represents the assumptions we are making about the marketer prospect. 

## Experience
We are assuming that the marketer has tried out a few AI SaaS solutions for marketing, and are heavily present on social media. They may be following the likes of Boring Marketer, and other marketers and feeling left out / overwhelmed by the entire industry. They are pursuing this course to empower themselves. 

They have limited knowledge of LLMs, but have used the Chat Interfaces. As far as they are aware LLMs are just chatbots, and an AI app is essentially magic. They are still heavily impressed by the latest AI video demos and fall for benchmarks that are made up by LLM providers.
