# Class 2: IDE Setup Guide

**Course:** AMA Fundamentals
**Class Number:** 2 of 7 (Setup Component)
**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Class 1 (understanding of MCP)

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up your IDE-based marketing workspace. By the end, you'll have:

-  VS Code or Cursor installed
-  Claude Code extension configured
-  MCP connections working (`.mcp.json`)
-  Agent instructions configured (`CLAUDE.md`)
-  Ready to start building your file-based marketing system

**Important:** This is a one-time setup. Once complete, you'll use this workspace for all future classes.

## Part 1: Choose Your IDE

You need a code editor (IDE) to work with files and Claude Code. You have two excellent options:

### Option A: VS Code (Recommended for Beginners)

**What it is:** Microsoft's free, open-source code editor. Industry standard, massive community, extremely stable.

**Pros:**
- Free and open source
- Huge ecosystem of extensions
- Excellent documentation
- Works on Mac, Windows, Linux
- Lightweight and fast

**Cons:**
- No built-in AI (you add it via Claude Code extension)
- Slightly more setup required for AI features

**Download:** [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

**Installation:**
1. Download the installer for your OS
2. Run the installer
3. Open VS Code
4. Done! (It's that simple)

---

### Option B: Cursor (Recommended for AI-Heavy Work)

**What it is:** A fork of VS Code built specifically for AI-assisted development. Same interface as VS Code, but with native AI integration.

**Pros:**
- Built-in AI features (chat, inline editing)
- All VS Code features + AI superpowers
- Smooth AI experience out of the box
- Fast AI completions

**Cons:**
- Paid (free tier available, but limited)
- Smaller community than VS Code
- Some extensions may lag behind VS Code versions

**Download:** [https://cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)

**Installation:**
1. Download the installer for your OS
2. Run the installer
3. Open Cursor
4. Sign in or create account
5. Done!

### Which Should You Choose?

**Choose VS Code if:**
- You want free, stable, industry-standard tools
- You're new to code editors
- You want maximum flexibility and community support

**Choose Cursor if:**
- You want native AI features built-in
- You're willing to pay for enhanced AI experience
- You prioritize speed of AI interactions

**Our recommendation:** Start with VS Code. It's free, stable, and you'll learn the fundamentals. You can always switch to Cursor later (they're nearly identical).

**For this course:** All examples use VS Code, but everything works identically in Cursor.

## Part 2: Install Claude Code Extension

Claude Code is Anthropic's official extension that brings Claude AI into your IDE.

### Installation Steps (VS Code)

1. **Open VS Code**

2. **Open Extensions panel:**
   - Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (looks like 4 squares)
   - Or press `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows)

3. **Search for "Claude Code":**
   - Type "Claude Code" in the search bar
   - Look for the official extension by Anthropic
   - Click "Install"

4. **Authenticate:**
   - After installation, click "Sign in to Claude"
   - Authorize with your Anthropic account
   - You'll need a Claude Pro subscription or API key

5. **Verify installation:**
   - You should see a Claude icon in the left sidebar
   - Click it to open the Claude Code panel
   - Test by asking: "Can you see this workspace?"

### Installation Steps (Cursor)

Cursor comes with AI built-in, but you can still install Claude Code for enhanced features:

1. Follow the same steps as VS Code above
2. Cursor's native AI and Claude Code can coexist
3. Choose which one to use per task

## Part 3: Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP lets Claude connect to external data sources (websites, Notion, Slack, etc.). You configure it via `.mcp.json` in your workspace root.

### What is .mcp.json?

A configuration file that tells Claude Code which MCP servers to connect to. Each server gives Claude a new capability (web scraping, Notion access, etc.).

**Location:** Root of your workspace (same level as your folders)

```
/your-workspace/
