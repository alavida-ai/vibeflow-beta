# Target Audience

## Primary Audience: Marketing Architects

**Who they are:**
- Marketing professionals using AMA for brand strategy and content creation
- May have limited technical background
- Need to understand HOW to use the system, not HOW to build it
- Want to leverage AI agents effectively for marketing workflows

**What they need:**
- Understanding of WHY AMA is structured the way it is
- Practical knowledge of how to navigate and use the system
- Confidence in creating research, strategy, and content workflows
- Ability to delegate effectively to AI agents

**Learning style:**
- Conceptual understanding first (why it works this way)
- Practical application second (how to use it)
- Real examples from marketing context
- Hands-on exercises with immediate application

## Secondary Audience: Developers New to AMA

**Who they are:**
- Developers interested in agentic systems
- May want to extend or customize AMA
- Already understand technical concepts (APIs, file systems, etc.)
- Need to understand AMA's specific patterns and architecture

**What they need:**
- Deep understanding of architectural decisions
- Knowledge of how to extend the system
- Understanding of agent orchestration patterns
- Ability to create new skills and workflows

**Learning style:**
- Technical depth preferred
- Code examples and implementations
- Architecture diagrams and patterns
- References to underlying principles

## Course Design Implications

**Start with fundamentals:**
- Assume no deep technical knowledge (but build it up)
- Explain LLM concepts in accessible terms
- Show WHY before HOW
- Use marketing examples throughout

**Progressive complexity:**
- Class 1-3: Foundational concepts anyone can grasp
- Class 4-6: Intermediate patterns with technical details
- Class 7-8: Advanced orchestration and hands-on practice

**Dual-track learning:**
- Core content accessible to all audiences
- "Technical Deep Dive" callouts for developers
- "Marketing Application" examples for marketers
- Both audiences can learn from each other's perspective

## Success Metrics

**For Marketing Architects:**
- Can plan and execute research workflows independently

- Confidently generate on-brand content
- Know when to orchestrate vs when to execute directly

**For Developers:**
- Understand architectural patterns and principles
- Can extend AMA with new skills
- Can customize workflows for specific needs
- Can contribute improvements to the system

## Tone and Style

- **Accessible but not dumbed down** - Explain complexity clearly
- **Practical over theoretical** - Real examples, working code
- **Empowering** - Build confidence through understanding
- **Collaborative** - Marketing Architects and developers learn together
