### Progression Indicators

- **Classes 1-2** (Foundation): Complete these first - they explain WHY the methodology exists
- **Classes 3-5** (Architecture): Build understanding of the file structure and patterns
- **Classes 6-7** (Coordination): Learn execution patterns and workflow management
- **Class 8** (Integration): Apply everything in a realistic scenario

**Checkpoint Questions:**
- After Class 2: "Can I explain why context overflow matters?"
- After Class 5: "Do I understand the /brand/ directory structure?"
- After Class 7: "Can I explain the PLAN.md/TODO.md pattern?"
- After Class 8: "Could I implement this in my own project?"

**Linear Learning (Recommended for first-time learners):**
```
"Show me Class 1" or "Start the AMA Fundamentals Course"
```

**Jump to Specific Topic:**
```
"I want to learn about [topic]"
- LLM fundamentals → Class 1
- Context management → Class 2
- File structure → Classes 3-4
- Evidence chains → Class 5
- Multi-agent patterns → Class 6
- Workflow execution → Class 7
- Complete case study → Class 8
```

### Navigation Between Classes

**Move Forward:**
```
"Next class" or "Continue to Class [N]"
```

**Review Previous:**
```
"Go back to Class [N]" or "Review [topic]"
```

**Jump Anywhere:**
```
"Show me Class [N]" or "Take me to [class name]"
```

### Completing Exercises

Each class includes hands-on exercises. To work through them:

```
"Let's do the Class [N] exercises"
```

The agent will guide you through practice activities step-by-step.

### Getting Help

**Clarification:**
```
"Explain [concept] from Class [N] again"
```

**Examples:**
```
"Show me an example of [pattern/concept]"
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```
"I'm stuck on [topic]"
```
