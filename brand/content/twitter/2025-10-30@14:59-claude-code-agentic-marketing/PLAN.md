# Execution Plan: Twitter Post - Claude Code for Agentic Marketing

**Created:** 2025-10-30@14:59
**Type:** Content (Twitter)
**Objective:** Create a Twitter post showcasing how Claude Code enables agentic marketing workflows

---

## Context

**Task:** Write a tweet about how Claude Code can be used for agentic marketing workflows

**Strategic Foundation:**
- [Voice Strategy](/brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md) - Technical peer, intellectually provocative, ownership-focused
- [Twitter Voice Extension](/brand/strategy/voice/twitter/EXTENSION.md) - Conversation-starting formats, thread optimization
- [Messaging Strategy](/brand/strategy/messaging/STRATEGY.md) - Core themes and positioning
- [Positioning Strategy](/brand/strategy/positioning/STRATEGY.md) - Category definition and differentiation

**Tweet Purpose:**
- Demonstrate concrete value of Claude Code for marketing workflows
- Position Vibeflow's technical sophistication
- Generate conversation through systems-thinking insight
- Show real-world application (not abstract promises)

---

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Strategy Context Loading
**Objective:** Load required strategy documents to inform content

**Artifacts:**
- `01-strategy-context.md` - Summary of relevant voice, messaging, positioning guidelines

**Tasks:**
- Load Voice Strategy (universal + Twitter extension)
- Load Messaging Strategy (core themes)
- Load Positioning Strategy (category framing)
- Extract relevant guidelines for this specific content type

**Delegation:** Direct execution (no sub-agent needed for reading)

---

### Phase 2: Content Angle Development
**Objective:** Develop specific angle/hook for the Claude Code tweet

**Artifacts:**
- `02-content-angles.md` - 3-5 potential tweet angles with strategic rationale

**Approach Options:**
1. **Systems-thinking angle:** Claude Code as orchestration infrastructure (not just a tool)
2. **Technical credibility angle:** Show actual workflow (MCP integration, multi-agent coordination)
3. **Provocative contrast:** "AI marketing tools" vs. "AI marketing infrastructure"
4. **Ownership angle:** IDE-based workflows = owned infrastructure vs. SaaS lock-in
5. **Productivity paradox:** Why having better tools doesn't automatically mean better output

**Tasks:**
- Generate 3-5 tweet angle options
- Evaluate against voice strategy (technically credible, provocative, ownership-focused)
- Evaluate against Twitter optimization (conversation-starting, reply-worthy)
- Recommend strongest angle with rationale

**Delegation:** Content creation sub-agent (requires creative synthesis)

---

### Phase 3: Tweet Drafting
**Objective:** Write tweet(s) following selected angle and voice guidelines

**Artifacts:**
- `03-tweet-draft.md` - Completed tweet (standalone or thread) with strategic notes

**Format Options:**
1. **Single tweet** (200-280 chars) - Claim + Evidence + Invitation
2. **Short thread** (2-3 tweets) - Hook → Insight → Invitation
3. **Medium thread** (4-5 tweets) - Hook → Evidence → Analysis → Implication → Invitation

**Tasks:**
- Write tweet following voice guidelines (active voice, concrete language, no hedging)
- Apply Twitter-specific adaptations (conversation hook, character optimization)
- Include reply engagement strategy
- Note any rich media opportunities (screenshot of workflow, video idea)

**Delegation:** Content creation sub-agent (synthesis + voice execution)

---

### Phase 4: Voice Compliance Review
**Objective:** Verify tweet adheres to voice strategy before approval

**Artifacts:**
- `04-voice-review.md` - Compliance checklist with pass/fail + revision notes

**Review Criteria:**
- ✅ Universal voice maintained (technically credible, provocative, ownership-focused, evidence-based, systems-thinking)
- ✅ Twitter adaptations applied (conversation invitation, character constraints, thread structure if applicable)
- ✅ Algorithm optimization without compromise (generates natural replies, quality over engagement-bait)
- ✅ Forbidden language avoided (no patronizing, no hype without evidence, no generic SaaS language)

**Tasks:**
- Run tweet through voice consistency checklist
- Identify any voice violations
- Recommend revisions if needed
- Provide final approval or iteration direction

**Delegation:** Analyst sub-agent (objective evaluation against criteria)

---

### Phase 5: Final Content Package
**Objective:** Prepare polished tweet with publishing guidance

**Artifacts:**
- `CONTENT.md` - Final approved tweet ready for review/publishing

**Deliverable:**
- Final tweet text (optimized for copy-paste)
- Reply engagement strategy (how to respond in first 2-3 hours)
- Rich media recommendations (if applicable)
- Posting timing guidance
- Strategic rationale (why this angle, how it serves brand positioning)

**Tasks:**
- Compile final tweet
- Document engagement approach
- Provide posting best practices
- Explain strategic value

**Delegation:** Direct execution (compilation)

---

## Success Criteria

**Voice Alignment:**
- Sounds like technical peer (not teacher or helper)
- States something provocative (challenges conventional thinking)
- Reinforces ownership philosophy
- Demonstrates systems-thinking

**Twitter Optimization:**
- Generates conversation naturally (not forced engagement)
- Works within character constraints without dilution
- Includes conversation invitation
- Optimized for reply engagement (75x weight)

**Strategic Value:**
- Advances Vibeflow positioning (Marketing Architecture, not marketing automation)
- Demonstrates technical credibility
- Differentiates from generic AI marketing tools
- Serves as shareable brand artifact

## Notes

- **Character limit awareness:** Twitter = 280 chars (single tweet) or thread format
- **Voice priority:** Maintain voice over forcing algorithm optimization
- **Evidence-based:** If making claims, cite/reference (even in short format)
- **Conversation > broadcast:** End with invitation, not declaration
- **Rich media optional:** Video/screenshot can amplify but not required for this task
