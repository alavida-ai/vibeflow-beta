**Execution Date:** 2025-11-13@17:18
**Type:** Strategic brand terminology update
**Scope:** Framework-wide rename across active strategy, research, and system configuration

## Objective

Execute systematic rename of "vibeflow" to "agonda" across the Agentic Marketing Architecture framework, ensuring brand consistency while preserving historical audit trails.

---

## Context

The Marketing Architect has decided to rename the Agentic Marketing Architecture framework from "vibeflow" to "agonda". This requires updates across:
- Active strategy documents (positioning, voice, messaging, brand fundamentals)
- Research indexes (customer insights)
- System configuration files (agent hooks, skills)

- `/brand/strategy/voice/twitter/EXTENSION.md` (title + content)
- `/brand/strategy/messaging/STRATEGY.md`
- `/brand/strategy/brand-fundamentals/2025-10-28_10:23/STRATEGY.md`

- `.claude/skills/landing-page-conversion/SKILL.md`

**Category 4: Historical Executions (50+ files) - UPDATE ALL**
Based on Marketing Architect approval for "full update", updating all historical executions to maintain consistency

**Category 5: Build Artifacts - SKIP**
- `/app/.next/*` files will auto-regenerate

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All active strategy documents reference "agonda"
- ✅ Research indexes updated

## Implementation Notes

**Case Handling:**

**Context Preservation:**
- File paths remain unchanged (working directory is still `/vibeflow-beta/`)
- Git repository name unchanged
- Historical audit trail preserved (timestamps + CHANGELOG pattern)
