# Artifact 12: Hook Structure

**Objective:** Define first 30-second framework ensuring viewer retention and packaging alignment.

---

## Part 1: Hook Architecture

### The 30-Second Framework

**Hook = 2 critical functions in first 30 seconds:**
1. **0-7 seconds:** Confirm packaging promise (respect the click)
2. **8-30 seconds:** Create new curiosity loop (give reason to stay)

**Why this structure matters:**
- Viewer clicked based on thumbnail + title promise
- First 7 seconds must confirm they made right decision
- If confirmation fails → instant bounce
- Next 23 seconds must create NEW reason to watch beyond initial promise
- If no new curiosity → viewer leaves after getting initial answer

---

### 0-7 Seconds: Click Confirmation

**Purpose:** Respect the click, confirm packaging promise

**Execution:** State exactly what viewer will get

**Brand voice requirements:**
- Direct and specific (no fluff)
- Active voice construction
- Concrete deliverables mentioned
- Technical credibility from first sentence

**Formula:**
```
"In this video, I'm [building/designing/architecting] [specific system]
in [technology] that [concrete outcome with number]."
```

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ "Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel..."
- ❌ "Before we get started, let me tell you a story..."
- ❌ "In today's video, we're going to explore..."
- ❌ Any intro music, logo animation, or preamble

**What TO do:**
- ✅ Immediate value proposition
- ✅ Confirm thumbnail promise visually (show what was in thumbnail)
- ✅ State concrete outcome
- ✅ Use ownership language ("I'm building" not "I'm going to show you how to use")

---

### 8-30 Seconds: New Curiosity Loop

**Purpose:** Create next reason to watch beyond initial promise

**Execution:** Tease unexpected insight, process, or outcome viewer doesn't expect

**Brand voice requirements:**
- Evidence-based teaser (hint at specific data or outcome)
- Contrarian angle preview (what makes this different)
- Systems thinking language (workflow, infrastructure, architecture)
- Intellectual engagement (challenge assumption, reveal truth)

**Formula:**
```
"But first, let me show you why [common approach] [fails/costs you/limits you]—
and why [your approach] [contrarian benefit]."
```

**Techniques:**
1. **Tease coming revelation:** Preview surprising insight or data
2. **Show consequence/benefit:** Hint at what viewer will be able to do
3. **Introduce mystery:** Pose question that video will answer
4. **Pattern interrupt:** Visual change, B-roll, system screenshot

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Fully explain the solution (no reason to keep watching)
- ❌ Generic hype ("this is amazing," "you won't believe it")
- ❌ Begging for engagement ("don't forget to like and subscribe")
- ❌ Unnecessary context or backstory

**What TO do:**
- ✅ Create specific gap: "Most people do X, but X actually causes Y problem"
- ✅ Tease contrarian insight: "The real solution isn't what you think"
- ✅ Preview concrete outcome: "By the end, you'll see [deliverable 1], [2], [3]"
- ✅ Establish credibility: "I've been using this for [time], here's what I learned"

---

## Part 2: Hook Templates (per Bucket)

### Bucket A: "Claude Code for Marketers" Hook Template

**Video type:** Technical tutorials, system walkthroughs, hands-on building

**Full 30-second structure:**

```
[0-7 SEC: CONFIRMATION]
"In this video, I'm [building/designing] [specific system] in Claude Code
that [concrete outcome with number]."

[8-20 SEC: CREDIBILITY + CONTEXT]
"I've been using this [workflow/system] for [time period], and it [specific result].
By the end, you'll see [deliverable 1], [deliverable 2], and [deliverable 3]."

[21-30 SEC: NEW CURIOSITY]
"But first, let me show you why [common approach] [fails/costs you/limits you]—
and why [your approach] [contrarian benefit]."
```

---

**Example 1: Multi-Agent Content System**

**Title:** "30 On-Brand Tweets Per Week: Claude Code Multi-Agent System"
**Thumbnail:** System screenshot + face, text "BUILDING CONTENT ENGINE"

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"In this video, I'm building a multi-agent content system in Claude Code
that generates 30 tweets per week without AI slop."

[8-20 SEC]
"I've been using this workflow for 3 months, and it's completely replaced
my content calendar SaaS subscriptions. By the end, you'll see the exact agents,
the prompts, and the quality control system."

[21-30 SEC]
"But first, let me show you why most AI content fails the brand voice test—
and why human-guided agents solve this."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Confirms "30 tweets" and "Claude Code" from packaging
- 8-20 sec: Credibility (3 months), outcome (replaced SaaS), deliverables (agents, prompts, QC)
- 21-30 sec: New gap (why AI content fails + solution preview)

---

**Example 2: Research Workflow with Citation**

**Title:** "Building Marketing Research Infrastructure That Cites Sources: Claude + Firecrawl"
**Thumbnail:** Code + outcome (research report with citations visible)

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"In this video, I'm building a research automation system in Claude Code
that generates 10-page reports with verified citations in under 15 minutes."

[8-20 SEC]
"I've been running this workflow for 6 months across 50+ client projects.
By the end, you'll see the MCP server integration, the Firecrawl scraping setup,
and the Perplexity verification workflow."

[21-30 SEC]
"But first, let me show you why most AI research tools hallucinate sources—
and why this architecture eliminates that problem."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Confirms concrete outcome (10-page reports, verified citations, 15 min)
- 8-20 sec: Validation (6 months, 50+ projects), technical deliverables (MCP, Firecrawl, Perplexity)
- 21-30 sec: Problem awareness (hallucination) + solution tease (architecture)

---

**Example 3: Self-Hosted Infrastructure**

**Title:** "From $500/Month SaaS to $0 Self-Hosted Stack: Docker + Claude Code"
**Thumbnail:** Before/after split (SaaS logos vs clean terminal)

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"In this video, I'm building a self-hosted marketing infrastructure that replaced
$500 per month in SaaS subscriptions with zero recurring costs."

[8-20 SEC]
"I've been running this stack for 8 months with 100% uptime. By the end,
you'll see the Docker setup, the MCP integrations, and the cost breakdown."

[21-30 SEC]
"But first, let me show you why per-seat pricing extracts more value when you scale—
and why infrastructure ownership changes that equation completely."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Dramatic cost claim ($500 → $0), confirms thumbnail before/after
- 8-20 sec: Validation (8 months, 100% uptime), technical credibility (Docker, MCP)
- 21-30 sec: Contrarian economics (per-seat extraction) + ownership positioning

---

### Bucket B: "Marketing Systems 101" Hook Template

**Video type:** Educational frameworks, thought leadership, contrarian positioning

**Full 30-second structure:**

```
[0-7 SEC: CONFIRMATION]
"In this video, I'm explaining [framework/concept] that [transforms/enables]
[specific outcome]."

[8-20 SEC: PROBLEM SETUP]
"Here's the problem: [industry practice] [negative consequence].
Most marketers [common mistake] because [underlying issue]."

[21-30 SEC: SOLUTION TEASE]
"I'm going to show you [alternative approach] that [contrarian benefit]—
starting with [framework component]."
```

---

**Example 1: Human-in-Loop Framework**

**Title:** "Why AI Should Augment Marketers, Not Replace Them: The Human-in-Loop Model"
**Thumbnail:** Framework diagram + face, text "HUMAN-IN-LOOP"

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"In this video, I'm explaining the human-in-loop model that transforms
AI from replacement threat to leverage multiplier."

[8-20 SEC]
"Here's the problem: the AI marketing industry promises to automate marketers
out of existence. But automation without judgment produces AI slop that
fails brand voice tests and erodes trust."

[21-30 SEC]
"I'm going to show you the architecture where humans guide and AI executes—
starting with why judgment is the bottleneck AI can't solve."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Framework name confirmed, outcome clear (replacement → leverage)
- 8-20 sec: Industry problem stated directly (automation = slop), relatable pain (brand voice)
- 21-30 sec: Solution architecture teased (human guides, AI executes), philosophical hook (judgment)

---

**Example 2: Infrastructure Ownership Positioning**

**Title:** "Stop Renting Your Marketing Stack—Build Your Own Infrastructure"
**Thumbnail:** Contrarian visual (crossed-out SaaS logos, text "STOP RENTING")

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"In this video, I'm explaining why marketing infrastructure ownership
is the strategic advantage competitors can't replicate."

[8-20 SEC]
"Here's the problem: SaaS vendors charge more when you scale, never less.
Most marketers accept subscription lock-in because they don't realize
self-hosting is within reach."

[21-30 SEC]
"I'm going to show you the infrastructure ownership ladder—
starting with why renting limits strategic flexibility."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Contrarian positioning confirmed (ownership = advantage)
- 8-20 sec: Economics exposed (scale = higher costs), assumption challenged (self-hosting possible)
- 21-30 sec: Framework teased (ownership ladder), strategic framing (flexibility)

---

**Example 3: Systems Thinking Framework**

**Title:** "From Tool User to Marketing Architect: The Infrastructure Mindset"
**Thumbnail:** Framework diagram showing transformation journey

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"In this video, I'm explaining the shift from tactical tool user
to marketing architect who designs systems competitors can't replicate."

[8-20 SEC]
"Here's the problem: most marketers work IN the business executing tasks,
not ON the business architecting workflows. That keeps them reactive
instead of strategic."

[21-30 SEC]
"I'm going to show you the infrastructure mindset framework—
starting with why systems thinking compounds while tactics don't."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Identity transformation confirmed (tool user → architect)
- 8-20 sec: Relatable problem (IN vs ON business), consequence clear (reactive vs strategic)
- 21-30 sec: Framework teased (infrastructure mindset), value proposition (compounding)

---

### Bucket C: "Building in Public" Hook Template

**Video type:** Behind-the-scenes, progress updates, transparent learning

**Full 30-second structure:**

```
[0-7 SEC: CONFIRMATION]
"This is Episode [#] of Building in Public—today I'm [specific work being done]."

[8-20 SEC: CONTEXT + PROGRESS]
"Here's where we're at: [progress update]. The goal for this episode
is [specific milestone]."

[21-30 SEC: TRANSPARENCY TEASE]
"I'm going to show you [what worked], [what didn't], and [key learning]—
completely unfiltered."
```

---

**Example 1: System Building Episode**

**Title:** "Building in Public Ep. 3: Multi-Agent Content System (What Worked + What Failed)"
**Thumbnail:** Raw workspace + "EP. 3" branding, text "CONTENT SYSTEM"

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"This is Episode 3 of Building in Public—today I'm building the quality control
layer for my multi-agent content system."

[8-20 SEC]
"Here's where we're at: agents are generating 30 tweets per week, but 15%
still fail brand voice tests. The goal for this episode is to get that
failure rate below 5%."

[21-30 SEC]
"I'm going to show you what worked (the validation prompts), what didn't
(the scoring system I tried first), and the key learning about where
human judgment is non-negotiable—completely unfiltered."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Episode confirmed, specific work stated (QC layer)
- 8-20 sec: Progress transparent (30 tweets, 15% failure), goal concrete (<5%)
- 21-30 sec: Three-part tease (worked/didn't/learned), authenticity promised (unfiltered)

---

**Example 2: Infrastructure Migration**

**Title:** "Building in Public Ep. 7: Migrating from SaaS to Self-Hosted (6-Month Update)"
**Thumbnail:** Progress dashboard showing cost savings over time

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"This is Episode 7 of Building in Public—today I'm reviewing 6 months
of self-hosted infrastructure data."

[8-20 SEC]
"Here's where we're at: I've saved $3,200 in subscription costs,
but I've invested 40 hours in maintenance. The goal for this episode
is to calculate true ROI and decide if it's worth it."

[21-30 SEC]
"I'm going to show you the cost breakdown, the hidden maintenance time
most people ignore, and whether I'd make the same decision again—
with actual spreadsheets."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Episode confirmed, review focus clear (6-month data)
- 8-20 sec: Honest numbers (saved $3,200 but spent 40 hours), real question (ROI?)
- 21-30 sec: Transparency (hidden costs), evidence (spreadsheets), authentic (would you do it again?)

---

**Example 3: Learning Documentation**

**Title:** "Building in Public Ep. 12: What I Learned Building 100 Videos"
**Thumbnail:** Face + "EP. 12" + "100 VIDEOS" text

**Hook:**
```
[0-7 SEC]
"This is Episode 12 of Building in Public—today I'm reflecting on
100 videos, 50,000 views, and what actually moved the needle."

[8-20 SEC]
"Here's where we're at: I've published 100 videos over 6 months.
Some got 2,000 views, most got 200. The goal for this episode is to
identify the patterns that predict performance."

[21-30 SEC]
"I'm going to show you the 3 videos that drove 60% of total views,
the packaging patterns that consistently underperform, and the one mistake
I keep making—with my actual analytics."
```

**Why it works:**
- 0-7 sec: Milestone confirmed (100 videos), scope clear (what moved needle)
- 8-20 sec: Transparent data (2K vs 200 views), analytical focus (patterns)
- 21-30 sec: Specific insights (3 videos = 60%), self-awareness (mistakes), evidence (analytics)

---

## Part 3: Brand Voice Integration

### Required Elements in Every Hook

**1. Active Voice Construction (Never Passive)**
- ✅ "I'm building a system"
- ❌ "A system will be built"
- ✅ "I designed this workflow"
- ❌ "This workflow was designed"

**Why:** Active voice reinforces ownership, agency, and control—core to brand identity

---

**2. Ownership Language (Never Tool-User Framing)**
- ✅ "I'm building," "I'm designing," "I'm architecting"
- ❌ "I'm using," "I'm trying," "This tool lets you"
- ✅ "My infrastructure," "My system," "My workflow"
- ❌ "This platform," "This software," "The tool"

**Why:** Ownership language positions viewer as architect, not renter

---

**3. Specific Outcomes (Never Vague Claims)**
- ✅ "30 tweets per week," "70% cost reduction," "15-minute research reports"
- ❌ "More content," "Save money," "Faster research"
- ✅ "10-page reports with verified citations"
- ❌ "High-quality reports"

**Why:** Concrete numbers build credibility, vague claims sound like hype

---

**4. Contrarian Framing (When Applicable)**
- ✅ "Most people do X, but X actually causes Y"
- ✅ "The industry says Z, here's why that's wrong"
- ✅ "Why [common practice] limits you"
- ❌ Generic positioning without challenging assumptions

**Why:** Contrarian positioning signals intellectual engagement, not status quo acceptance

---

**5. Systems Thinking Vocabulary**
- ✅ "Infrastructure," "Workflows," "Architecture," "Systems," "Orchestration," "Framework"
- ❌ "Tools," "Hacks," "Tricks," "Tips," "Shortcuts"
- ✅ "Multi-agent orchestration," "Citation architecture," "Quality control layer"
- ❌ "AI helper," "Automation bot," "Content generator"

**Why:** Systems language positions as architect-level thinking, not tactical execution

---

### Prohibited Elements in Every Hook

**1. Hype Language**
- ❌ "This is amazing," "You won't believe this," "Game-changing," "Revolutionary"
- **Why:** Insults audience intelligence, sounds like generic marketing
- **Brand-aligned alternative:** Evidence-based statements ("I've saved $3,200 over 6 months")

---

**2. Ease Promises**
- ❌ "Super easy," "Anyone can do this," "No experience needed," "Simple 3-step process"
- **Why:** Contradicts ownership philosophy (infrastructure requires craft)
- **Brand-aligned alternative:** "Systematic approach to building X"

---

**3. Generic Claims**
- ❌ "Better results," "More productive," "Improved workflow"
- **Why:** Vague, unmeasurable, unverifiable
- **Brand-aligned alternative:** "10x research output," "70% cost reduction," "30 tweets per week"

---

**4. Tool-User Framing**
- ❌ "Using this tool to automate," "This platform lets you," "The software does X"
- **Why:** Positions as dependent renter, not independent architect
- **Brand-aligned alternative:** "Building infrastructure that," "Architecting system to," "Designing workflow for"

---

**5. Begging for Engagement**
- ❌ "Don't forget to like and subscribe," "Hit the bell icon," "Help me reach [goal]"
- **Why:** Breaks immersion, feels transactional, audience rejects it
- **Brand-aligned alternative:** Focus on value delivery (engagement follows quality)

---

**6. Unnecessary Preamble**
- ❌ "Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel," "Before we get started," "In today's video"
- **Why:** Wastes critical 0-7 second confirmation window
- **Brand-aligned alternative:** Immediate value ("In this video, I'm building X")

---

## Part 4: Retention Tactics

### Pattern Interrupts (Use Sparingly)

**What:** Visual or audio changes that recapture wandering attention

**When to use:**
- Every 3-5 seconds in talking-head segments (prevents monotony)
- Transitions between concepts (signals topic shift)
- Before key insights (emphasizes importance)

**Types:**

**1. Jump Cuts (Primary Pattern Interrupt)**
- Cut out pauses, breaths, filler words
- Maintains fast pacing without feeling rushed
- Standard for YouTube educational content

**2. Visual Overlays**
- Screenshots of systems being discussed
- Text highlighting key terms or numbers
- Diagrams illustrating concepts
- B-roll of relevant work

**3. Camera Angle Changes**
- Wide shot → close-up (emphasizes point)
- Screen share → on-camera (human connection)
- Over-the-shoulder → direct address (variety)

**4. Music/Sound Design (Subtle, Not Distracting)**
- Background music fades up/down at transitions
- Sound effects for visual elements appearing (subtle whoosh, not cartoonish)
- Silence for emphasis (remove music before key insight)

**Caution:** Overuse = sensory overload. Use intentionally, not constantly.

---

### Pacing Guidelines

**Hook (0-30 sec): Fast**
- Pack maximum value into minimum time
- Jump cuts every 2-3 seconds
- No pauses, no filler
- Every sentence must advance promise confirmation or curiosity creation

**Body (30 sec - 90% of video): Medium**
- Match pacing to technical depth
- Allow breathing room for complex concepts
- Balance jump cuts (maintain energy) with pauses (allow comprehension)
- Pattern interrupts every 15-30 seconds

**Payoff (Final 10%): Slow**
- Let outcome resonate (don't rush the win)
- Show results clearly (pause on screenshots, data, outputs)
- Summarize key takeaways (viewers appreciate recap)
- End on clear CTA (what to build next, where to learn more)

---

### Visual Engagement Tactics

**1. Show, Don't Just Tell**
- If you say "30 tweets per week," show grid of 30 tweets
- If you mention "70% cost reduction," show graph/spreadsheet
- If you reference "Claude Code workflow," screen-share the actual workflow

**2. On-Screen Text for Key Points**
- Reinforce spoken words with visual text
- Helps non-native speakers and viewers without audio
- Emphasizes memorable takeaways

**3. Progress Indicators**
- Chapter markers (YouTube chapters visible in progress bar)
- Verbal signposts ("First," "Next," "Finally")
- Visual checklists (checking off steps as you complete them)

**4. Real-Time Building**
- Viewers prefer watching actual work over talking about work
- Show terminal commands executing
- Show code being written
- Show content being generated

---

### Engagement Triggers (Psychological)

**1. Open Loops (Create → Resolve)**
- Open: "Most people miss the key mistake" (viewer wonders: what mistake?)
- Resolve: Later in video, explain the mistake
- Creates sustained attention (brain wants closure)

**2. Pattern Breaks (Unexpected Insights)**
- Viewer expects A, you deliver B
- Example: "You'd think more agents = better quality, but I found the opposite"
- Surprise = attention + memorability

**3. Relatable Pain → Solution**
- Acknowledge shared frustration (brand voice failures, subscription costs, hallucination)
- Show concrete solution (viewer sees path from pain to resolution)
- Emotional payoff = satisfaction + likelihood to share

**4. Evidence-Based Credibility**
- Show spreadsheets, analytics, actual data
- Viewer trust increases with transparency
- "I've been saying this for months" < "Here's my 6-month data showing this"

---

## Part 5: Hook-Content Alignment

### Packaging Makes Promise → Hook Confirms → Body Delivers

**Alignment check:**
1. **Thumbnail + Title** create expectation
2. **0-7 sec hook** confirms that expectation
3. **8-30 sec hook** creates NEW expectation
4. **Body of video** delivers on BOTH expectations
5. **Payoff** satisfies original promise + resolves new curiosity

**Example of perfect alignment:**

**Thumbnail:** System screenshot + face, text "30 TWEETS/WEEK"
**Title:** "Building Multi-Agent Content System in Claude Code: 30 Tweets Per Week"

**Hook (0-7 sec):** "In this video, I'm building a multi-agent system in Claude Code that generates 30 tweets per week without AI slop."
→ Confirms thumbnail ("30 tweets/week") and title ("multi-agent," "Claude Code")

**Hook (8-30 sec):** "But first, let me show you why most AI content fails brand voice tests—and why human-guided agents solve this."
→ Creates NEW curiosity (why AI content fails + how to solve)

**Body:** Shows:
- Agent architecture (confirms "multi-agent")
- Claude Code implementation (confirms technology)
- 30-tweet output (confirms outcome)
- Brand voice quality control (resolves new curiosity)
- Human-in-loop guidance (resolves "how agents solve this")

**Payoff:** Grid of 30 on-brand tweets + quality metrics + "here's what you can build next"

**Result:** Viewer satisfaction, trust built, high retention, likely to watch next video

---

### Misalignment = Retention Drop

**Example of misalignment:**

**Thumbnail:** "STOP RENTING YOUR STACK"
**Title:** "Why SaaS Subscriptions Extract More Value When You Scale"

**Hook (0-7 sec):** "In this video, I'm going to talk about why SaaS might not be the best choice for growing companies."
→ WEAK: "Talk about" = passive, vague. Doesn't confirm contrarian positioning from thumbnail.

**Hook (8-30 sec):** "I've been thinking about this for a while, and I want to share some thoughts on subscription models."
→ FAILURE: No new curiosity, no concrete insight teased, no evidence promised.

**Result:** Viewer leaves (packaging promised bold contrarian economics, hook delivered wishy-washy opinion)

---

### Retention Checkpoint Questions

**After writing your hook, ask:**

1. **Does 0-7 sec confirm thumbnail + title promise EXACTLY?**
   - If viewer pauses at 3 seconds, would they say "yes, this is what I clicked for"?

2. **Does 8-30 sec create NEW reason to watch?**
   - If you fully delivered on 0-7 sec promise, would viewer still want to keep watching?

3. **Is every word in brand voice?**
   - Active voice? Ownership language? Systems vocabulary? Specific outcomes?

4. **Are concrete deliverables promised?**
   - Can viewer list 2-3 things they'll see by the end?

5. **Is contrarian angle clear (if applicable)?**
   - Does viewer understand what assumption is being challenged?

**If "no" to any question, rewrite before filming.**

---

## Summary: Hook Production Checklist

**Pre-production (scripting):**
- [ ] Write 0-7 sec confirmation (thumbnail + title promise stated exactly)
- [ ] Write 8-30 sec new curiosity (different angle, tease insight)
- [ ] Verify brand voice (active, ownership language, specific outcomes)
- [ ] Identify concrete deliverables (what viewer will see by end)
- [ ] Check alignment (hook → body → payoff path clear?)

**Production (filming):**
- [ ] Immediate start (no intro music, no preamble)
- [ ] Confirm packaging visually (show thumbnail element in first 7 sec)
- [ ] Deliver hook with energy (engaged, confident, direct)
- [ ] Maintain eye contact (connection with viewer)
- [ ] Film 3 takes minimum (select best energy/delivery)

**Post-production (editing):**
- [ ] Jump cuts every 2-3 seconds (fast pacing in hook)
- [ ] Visual overlays for key terms (reinforce spoken words)
- [ ] Pattern interrupts at transitions (maintain attention)
- [ ] Background music subtle (doesn't compete with voice)
- [ ] 0-30 sec reviewed 10+ times (most critical window)

**Launch:**
- [ ] Monitor retention graph in YouTube Studio after 24 hours
- [ ] Check if retention drops at 0-7 sec (packaging misalignment)
- [ ] Check if retention drops at 30 sec (no new curiosity created)
- [ ] Document learnings (which hook approaches work best?)

**Iteration:**
- [ ] Apply retention insights to next video hook
- [ ] Refine packaging → hook → body alignment
- [ ] Build pattern library of proven hook structures
- [ ] Scale quality through systematic process
