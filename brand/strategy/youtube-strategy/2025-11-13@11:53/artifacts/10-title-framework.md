# Artifact 10: Title Framework

**Objective:** Systematic title development process producing 30-40 variations per video aligned with brand voice and YouTube algorithm optimization.

---

## Part 1: Title Philosophy

### Human-First Principle (Paddy Galloway)

YouTube's algorithm (post-2007) prioritizes human appeal over keyword manipulation. Write titles that create curiosity gaps and drive clicks through emotional resonance and clear value propositions—not keyword stuffing.

**Core insight:** Algorithm reads titles as humans do. Optimize for snap decisions, not search engines.

**Curiosity gap mechanics:**
- Promise answer without fully revealing it
- Create desire to click to find out
- Brain experiences discomfort between what it knows and wants to know
- Satisfying this gap drives engagement

### Brand Voice Integration

Every title must embody Marketing Architects' technical credibility and ownership philosophy:

**Required elements:**
- **Technical specificity:** Name concrete technologies (Claude Code, MCP servers, Docker)
- **Ownership language:** "Building," "Architecting," "Designing" (NEVER "Using," "Trying")
- **Evidence-based claims:** Concrete numbers, timeframes, verifiable outcomes
- **Systems thinking vocabulary:** "Infrastructure," "Workflows," "Architecture," "Systems"
- **Contrarian positioning:** Challenge common practices, question industry narratives

**Prohibited elements:**
- Hype language: "Amazing," "Incredible," "Game-changing," "Revolutionary"
- Ease promises: "Easy," "Simple," "Effortless," "Anyone can"
- Generic tactics: "Hacks," "Secrets," "Tricks," "One weird trick"
- Passive construction: "This was built" → "Building this"
- Tool-user framing: "Using X to do Y" → "Building Y with X"

**Method 1: Formula application (20-25 titles)**
- Apply all 20 formulas to video concept
- Force-fit each formula even if awkward
- Prioritize formulas matching video bucket (A/B/C)

**Method 2: Free-form brainstorming (5-10 titles)**
- Write first-instinct titles without constraints
- Explore emotional angles (surprise, frustration, aspiration)
- Play with different value propositions

**Method 3: Competitor analysis (3-5 titles)**
- Search YouTube for related videos
- Note which titles have highest views
- Adapt successful patterns to your brand voice

**Method 4: Keyword research integration (2-5 titles)**
- Use YouTube autocomplete for search phrases
- Incorporate long-tail keywords naturally
- Front-load primary keywords

**Time investment:** 20-30 minutes (exponential ROI)

---

### Step 2: Scoring Phase (Evaluate Each Variation)

**Scoring rubric (1-10 for each dimension):**

#### Dimension 1: CTR Potential (Click-Worthiness)
- **10:** Creates strong curiosity gap, impossible to ignore
- **7-9:** Interesting, clear value proposition
- **4-6:** Somewhat intriguing but missable
- **1-3:** Boring, generic, or confusing

**Ask:** "Would I click this in a feed of competing thumbnails?"

---

#### Dimension 2: Brand Fit (Voice Alignment)
- **10:** Perfect embodiment of all brand voice attributes
- **7-9:** Strong brand voice, minor misalignment
- **4-6:** Generic tech language, missing distinctive elements
- **1-3:** Contradicts brand voice (hype, ease promises, passive)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Uses ownership language ("build/design/architect" not "use/try")?
- [ ] Includes technical specificity (concrete technologies)?
- [ ] Avoids prohibited language (easy/simple/hacks/secrets)?
- [ ] Active voice throughout?
- [ ] Systems thinking vocabulary?

---

#### Dimension 3: Searchability (SEO Optimization)
- **10:** Primary keyword front-loaded, natural integration
- **7-9:** Keywords present but not front-loaded
- **4-6:** Relevant but missing obvious search terms
- **1-3:** No searchability, purely creative

**Ask:** "What would someone search to find this video?"

---

**Total Score:** Sum of 3 dimensions (out of 30)

**Efficient scoring:**
1. Create spreadsheet with 30-40 title variations
2. Score each dimension quickly (1-2 minutes per title)
3. Sort by total score
4. Identify top 10 for refinement

---

### Step 3: Refinement Phase (Top 5-10 Variations)

**Goal:** Polish highest-scoring titles to production-ready quality.

#### Refinement 1: Character Length Optimization
- **Ideal range:** 50-60 characters
- **Minimum:** 45 characters (very short, punchy)
- **Maximum:** 65 characters (avoid cutoff on mobile)

**Test:** Type title in YouTube Studio, check mobile preview

---

#### Refinement 2: Keyword Front-Loading
- Move primary keyword to first 3-5 words
- Ensure searchability without sacrificing curiosity

**Example:**
- Before: "How I Reduced Research Time by 80% with Claude Code"
- After: "Claude Code Marketing Research: 80% Time Reduction"

---

#### Refinement 3: Emotional Trigger Check
- Does title create curiosity gap?
- Is there emotional resonance (frustration → solution, aspiration)?
- Does it promise concrete outcome?

**Power word integration (1-2 per title):**
- Exclusivity: "Secret," "Underrated," "Hidden"
- Authority: "Expert," "Pro," "Data"
- Curiosity: "Reveal," "Truth," "Discovery"

---

#### Refinement 4: Brand Voice Audit
**Final checklist:**
- [ ] Active voice dominant?
- [ ] Ownership language ("build" not "use")?
- [ ] Technical credibility (specific technologies)?
- [ ] Evidence-based framing (numbers, outcomes)?
- [ ] Systems thinking vocabulary?
- [ ] No hype/ease/generic language?
- [ ] Contrarian positioning (if applicable)?

---

#### Refinement 5: Clarity Test
**Ask:** "Can someone understand the value proposition in 1 second?"

If title requires mental decoding, simplify.

---

### Step 4: Selection Phase (Final 2-3 for Testing)

#### Primary Title (Launch Title)
- Highest total score (CTR + Brand + Search)
- Balanced across all three dimensions
- Production-ready, no further edits needed

#### Backup Title (48-Hour Swap Option)
- Alternative angle (different formula or emotional trigger)
- Use if primary CTR underperforms TAM average
- Test if impressions plateau without reaching target

#### Test Variation (Thumbnail Alignment)
- Complements thumbnail without redundancy
- Alternative curiosity gap approach
- Consider for A/B test if time allows

---

## Part 4: Brand Voice Requirements

## Part 5: A/B Testing Methodology

### When to Change Titles

**Trigger 1: CTR Underperformance**
- If CTR < TAM average after 48 hours
- Monitor YouTube Studio Analytics → Reach tab → CTR %
- Compare against channel average and niche benchmark

**Trigger 2: Impressions Plateau**
- If impressions stop growing without reaching target audience
- Algorithm interpretation: Low CTR = less distribution
- Indicates packaging (title + thumbnail) isn't resonating

**Trigger 3: Search Traffic Underperformance**
- If video isn't ranking for target keywords after 7 days
- Check YouTube Studio → Traffic Source → YouTube Search
- May need keyword front-loading adjustment

---

### How to Test

**Phase 1: Monitor Primary Title (48 hours)**
1. Upload video with primary title
2. Track CTR hourly for first 6 hours (critical window)
3. Compare CTR to:
   - Channel average
   - TAM benchmark (from competitive research)
   - Previous videos in same bucket

**Phase 2: Swap to Backup (If Needed)**
1. Change title in YouTube Studio
2. Keep thumbnail constant (isolate variable)
3. Monitor CTR delta over next 24 hours
4. Document: Which title? CTR change? Why it worked/failed?

**Phase 3: Long-Term Monitoring (7-30 days)**
1. Track search traffic growth
2. Monitor suggested video performance
3. Identify which title elements drive long-tail discovery
4. Build pattern library for future videos

---

### Testing Protocol

**Change one variable at a time:**
- Test title first (keep thumbnail constant)
- If title swap fails, then test thumbnail
- Never change both simultaneously (can't isolate cause)

**Document learnings:**
- Which formulas work for your audience?
- Which power words drive clicks?
- Which keyword placements rank better?
- Which emotional triggers resonate?

**Build pattern library:**
- Track title performance across videos
- Note recurring elements in high-CTR titles
- Develop personal style through iteration
- Double down on proven formulas

---

### What Success Looks Like

**CTR benchmarks:**
- 4-6%: Average (not bad, but improvable)
- 7-10%: Strong (above TAM average)
- 10%+: Exceptional (viral potential)

**Search traffic growth:**
- Appearing in top 10 results for primary keyword within 14 days
- Sustained traffic from long-tail variations over 30+ days
- Suggested video traffic increasing weekly

**Pattern recognition:**
- Knowing which formulas work for your niche
- Predicting CTR before publishing
- Developing distinctive title style
