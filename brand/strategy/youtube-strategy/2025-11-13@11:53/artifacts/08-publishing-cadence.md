# Publishing Cadence: Phase-Based Strategy

**Phase:** 3 - Launch Strategy & Publishing Cadence
**Created:** 2025-11-13
**Status:** Production-Ready Cadence Framework

---

## Executive Summary

This publishing strategy defines phase-based cadence aligned with Paddy Galloway's 3-phase growth framework (Establishment → Improvement → Optimization). Each phase has distinct goals, content focus, and success criteria optimized for sustainable channel growth without burnout.

**Core Philosophy:** Volume builds skills (Establishment), quality scales results (Improvement), systems compound growth (Optimization).

**Team Capacity:** 2 people, comfortable on camera, 7-8/10 technical depth capability.

---

## Phase 1: Establishment (Months 1-4)

### Primary Goal
**Build skills, establish niche, reach 1K subscribers**

Volume over perfection. Consistency over results. Reps matter more than refinement.

---

### Publishing Cadence

**2 videos per week** (Target: 24-32 videos total)

**Publishing days:** Monday and Thursday, 8:00 AM EST

**Rationale:**
- **Volume = skill development:** Each video improves packaging, hooks, technical presentation
- **Algorithm learning:** YouTube needs data to understand channel (more uploads = faster learning)
- **Catalog depth:** 24+ videos creates multiple entry points for discovery
- **Consistency signal:** Regular uploads build algorithmic trust

**Sustainability check:** Can team maintain 2x/week for 16 weeks without burnout?
- If yes: Commit to schedule
- If uncertain: Start with 1x/week, increase when process optimized

---

### Content Mix

**Bucket Distribution:**
- **80% Bucket A** (Claude Code tutorials) - 20-26 videos
- **15% Bucket B** (Systems frameworks) - 4-5 videos
- **5% Bucket C** (Building in Public) - 1-2 videos

**Strategic Rationale:**
- **Bucket A dominance:** Discovery engine through zero-competition keywords
- **Bucket B introduction:** Framework layer for retention (introduce Month 2-3)
- **Bucket C seeding:** Community series launch (Week 6-8)

**Month-by-Month Breakdown:**

**Month 1 (Videos 1-8):**
- 6 Bucket A (75%) - Foundation tutorials
- 2 Bucket B (25%) - Framework introduction
- 0 Bucket C - Too early, need subscriber base first

**Month 2 (Videos 9-16):**
- 6 Bucket A (75%) - Workflow expansion
- 1 Bucket B (12.5%) - Framework deepening
- 1 Bucket C (12.5%) - Launch Building in Public series

**Month 3 (Videos 17-24):**
- 6 Bucket A (75%) - Continue catalog building
- 1 Bucket B (12.5%) - Retention optimization
- 1 Bucket C (12.5%) - Community deepening

**Month 4 (Videos 25-32):**
- 6 Bucket A (75%) - Proven format replication
- 1 Bucket B (12.5%) - Thought leadership
- 1 Bucket C (12.5%) - Ongoing community series

---

### Pre-Production Allocation

**30% ideation/packaging, 70% production**

**Time breakdown per video (assuming 20-hour total investment):**

**Ideation & Packaging (6 hours):**
- 1 hour: Topic selection and keyword research
- 2 hours: Title generation (30-40 variations) and scoring
- 2 hours: Thumbnail creation (3 variations)
- 1 hour: Hook scripting and rehearsal

**Production (14 hours):**
- 2 hours: Script outline and talking points
- 3 hours: Filming (screen recording + talking head)
- 6 hours: Editing (cuts, graphics, sound)
- 2 hours: Final review and rendering
- 1 hour: Upload, description, scheduling

**Batch Production Strategy:**
- Film 2-4 videos in single day (reduces setup time)
- Edit throughout week (maintain 1-week buffer)
- Schedule uploads in advance (reduce day-of stress)

---

### Packaging Standards

**Title Standards:**
- Generate 30-40 variations minimum per video
- Score on curiosity/clarity/brand-fit/searchability (1-10 each)
- Select top 3 for A/B testing
- Character count: 50-60 optimal
- Brand voice: "Build" language, ownership terms, systems vocabulary

**Thumbnail Standards:**
- Create 3+ distinct variations per video
- Glance test: Comprehensible at 100x100px in <1 second

**Content Signals:**
- **Consistent upload schedule maintained:** No missed weeks
- **Subscriber growth trend established:** Upward trajectory visible
- **Channel authority signals:** Improving CTR and AVD over time
- **Top 10% performers identified:** 2-3 videos significantly outperform average

**What "success" looks like at end of Establishment:**
- ✅ 1K+ subscribers (algorithm recognizes channel)
- ✅ 24-32 videos published (catalog depth for discovery)
- ✅ Production pipeline sustainable (not burned out)
- ✅ Clear patterns identified (know what content works)
- ✅ Audience overlap 80%+ (bingeability confirmed)

**What to do if behind targets:**
- Don't panic - algorithm takes time to learn
- Focus on consistency over numbers
- Analyze top performers (what made them succeed?)
- Double down on proven formats
- Continue building catalog (compounding returns)

---

### Burnout Prevention

**Sustainability is key to long-term success.**

**Warning signs of burnout:**
- Dreading filming days
- Quality declining from exhaustion
- Missing upload deadlines consistently
- Losing enthusiasm for topic
- Team tension or conflict

**Prevention strategies:**

**1. Batch Production:**
- Film 2-4 videos in single day (reduces context switching)
- Edit throughout week (spreads workload)
- Maintain 1-week buffer (reduces deadline pressure)

**2. Reduce Scope If Needed:**
- Better 1 strong video/week than 2 mediocre videos
- Can adjust to 1x/week if team overwhelmed
- Quality decline hurts more than slower pace

**3. Simplify Production:**
- Reuse thumbnail templates (don't reinvent each time)
- Screen recording only (reduce talking head time)
- Shorter videos OK (15 min vs 25 min reduces editing)

**4. Take Strategic Breaks:**
- Month 4: Consider 1-week break before Improvement phase
- Schedule buffer weeks (film ahead, rest when needed)
- Don't sacrifice health for upload schedule

**Remember:** YouTube is a marathon, not a sprint. Sustainable pace beats explosive burnout.

---

## Phase 2: Improvement (Months 5-8)

### Primary Goal
**Quality over quantity, data-driven iteration, reach 10K subscribers**

Focus shifts from volume to optimization. Study what works, replicate winners systematically.

---

### Publishing Cadence

**1 video per week** (Target: 16-20 videos total)

**Publishing day:** Monday, 8:00 AM EST (or Thursday if Monday conflict)

**Rationale:**
- **Quality focus:** More time per video = higher production value
- **Algorithm improvement:** YouTube notices quality increase (CTR, AVD gains)
- **Reduced burnout:** Sustainable long-term pace
- **Audience expectation:** Weekly upload maintains consistency signal

**Transition timing:** Move to 1x/week at start of Month 5 (after 24-32 videos published).

**Cadence shift announcement:**
- Pin comment on final Month 4 video: "Starting Month 5, moving to weekly uploads for higher quality"
- Community post (if enabled): Explain focus on quality over quantity
- X/Twitter: Share rationale (transparency builds trust)

---

### Content Focus

**Sniper Approach: Replicate Top 10% Performers**

**Step 1: Outlier Analysis (Week 1 of Month 5)**

Review all Establishment phase videos and identify top 10% performers:
- **Metric:** Sort by total views (or views per day if older videos)
- **Identify 3-5 outliers:** Videos significantly above average
- **Pattern recognition:** What do they have in common?

**Analyze:**
- Title formula (which pattern worked?)
- Thumbnail style (what aesthetic performed?)
- Hook structure (what kept viewers?)
- Topic/keyword (which pain points resonated?)
- Format (tutorial vs framework vs comparison?)

**Example patterns to look for:**
- "Building X in Claude Code" titles outperform "How to X"
- Side-by-side comparison thumbnails get higher CTR
- Problem-solution hooks retain better than pure technical
- Workflow tutorials outperform conceptual frameworks

**Document learnings in "Formula Playbook"** - reference for all future content.

---

**Step 2: Strategic Content Mix**

**Bucket Distribution:**
- **70% Bucket A** (proven tutorial formats) - 11-14 videos
- **20% Bucket B** (thought leadership deepening) - 3-4 videos
- **10% Bucket C** (community building) - 2 videos

**Rationale:**
- **Bucket A:** Focus on proven winners (sniper approach)
- **Bucket B:** Increase strategic depth (premium positioning)
- **Bucket C:** Deepen community loyalty (superfan conversion)

**Content selection strategy:**

**Bucket A (Tutorial Content):**
- 60% replication of top performers (variations on proven formats)
- 20% adjacent topic exploration (maintain 80% overlap)
- 20% experimentation (test new approaches)

**Example:** If "Building Content Calendar" was top performer:
- Create "Building Email Sequence System" (similar format, adjacent topic)
- Create "Content Repurposing Workflow" (related pain point)
- Experiment with "Advanced Content Calendar Features" (depth variation)

**Bucket B (Framework Content):**
- Frameworks that support Bucket A tutorials
- Thought leadership differentiating from competitors
- Strategic depth for retention optimization

**Bucket C (Building in Public):**
- Bi-weekly or monthly episodes (consistency without overwhelming)
- Show development process behind top-performing systems
- Community feedback loop informing future content

---

### Pre-Production Allocation

**60% ideation/packaging, 40% production**

**Time breakdown per video (assuming 25-hour total investment):**

**Ideation & Packaging (15 hours):**
- 2 hours: Weekly ideation session (generate 100+ ideas)
- 2 hours: Topic validation (keyword research, audience fit)
- 3 hours: Title generation (40-50 variations) and systematic testing
- 4 hours: Thumbnail creation (3+ variations with A/B test plan)
- 2 hours: Hook scripting and multiple take rehearsal
- 2 hours: Outlier analysis and pattern application

**Production (10 hours):**
- 1 hour: Detailed script/outline
- 2 hours: Filming (more rehearsal, fewer takes needed)
- 5 hours: Editing (higher polish, graphics, animations)
- 1 hour: Final review
- 1 hour: Upload and scheduling

**Quality improvements enabled by extra time:**
- More polished editing (smoother cuts, better pacing)
- Professional graphics (motion graphics, visual frameworks)
- Multiple thumbnail variations (systematic A/B testing)
- Hook optimization (script multiple openings, test best)

---

### Packaging Standards

**Title Testing:**
- Generate 40-50 variations (more than Establishment)
- Test titles in advance (ask community, run informal polls)
- A/B test aggressively (change after 48 hours if underperforming)
- Document winning formulas (build replicable playbook)

**Thumbnail A/B Testing:**
- Create 3+ variations with distinct approaches
- Test in first 24-48 hours
- Swap if CTR below top-performer benchmark
- Track which templates perform best per bucket

**Hook Optimization:**
- Script 2-3 different hooks per video
- Film all variations
- Edit with best-performing hook
- Analyze retention curves (YouTube Studio analytics at 30-second mark)

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Review every video performance (weekly analytics check)
- Update Formula Playbook with learnings
- Apply insights to next video immediately
- Share learnings with team (continuous learning culture)

---

### Key Tactics

**1. 100 Ideas Per Week Generation**

**Monday morning ideation session (90 minutes):**
- Generate 100+ video ideas without filtering
- Use prompts: "What if I built X?" "Why does Y fail?" "X vs Y comparison"
- Apply elimination criteria (brand fit, searchability, producibility)
- Select top 3-5 for deeper research

**Elimination criteria:**
- ❌ Outside Marketing Architecture positioning
- ❌ Low search volume and low shareability
- ❌ Too complex to produce in 1 week
- ❌ Doesn't maintain 80% audience overlap
- ✅ Aligns with brand voice and capability-over-convenience philosophy
- ✅ Leverages zero-competition keywords or high-value pain points
- ✅ Replicates patterns from top performers

**Build 4-week backlog:** Always have 4 video concepts ready to produce.

---

**2. Maintain 80%+ Audience Overlap**

**Track overlap metrics:**
- YouTube Studio → Audience → "Viewers also watch"
- Should see your own videos prominently featured
- Target: 80%+ of viewers watch multiple videos per session

**If overlap dropping below 80%:**
- Return to core topics (less experimentation)
- Increase cross-referencing between videos
- Ensure consistent vocabulary and positioning
- Review whether new content feels "off-brand"

**Maintain overlap through:**
- Consistent vocabulary (systems, workflows, architect, infrastructure)
- Thematic coherence (all videos support Marketing Architect transformation)
- Cross-linking strategy (every video references 2-3 related videos)
- Bucket balance (70% Bucket A maintains core audience)

---

**3. Systematic A/B Testing**

**Testing protocol:**

**Titles:**
1. Upload with primary title
2. Monitor CTR for 24 hours
3. If below 6%, swap to variation #2
4. Monitor 24 more hours
5. Keep winner, document learning

**Thumbnails:**
1. Upload with thumbnail variation #1
2. Monitor CTR for 24 hours
3. If below 6%, swap to variation #2
4. Test until optimal (target: 7%+ CTR)

**Hooks:**
1. Analyze retention curve at 30-second mark
2. If drop-off >50%, consider re-editing with alternative hook
3. Document which hook patterns retain best
4. Apply learnings to future videos

**Data collection:**
- Weekly analytics review (every Monday morning)
- Track CTR, AVD, traffic sources, audience retention
- Identify patterns in top performers
- Update Formula Playbook with learnings

---

### Success Indicators

**Channel Growth:**
- **Month 5:** 500-800 new subscribers (cumulative 1,450-2,450)
- **Month 6:** 800-1,200 new subscribers (cumulative 2,250-3,650)
- **Month 7:** 1,000-1,500 new subscribers (cumulative 3,250-5,150)
- **Month 8:** 1,500-2,000 new subscribers (cumulative 4,750-7,150)
- **Goal:** 5K-10K subscribers by Month 8 (strong growth trajectory)

**Video Performance:**
- **CTR improvement:** 6-8% average (up from 4-6% in Establishment)
- **AVD improvement:** 52-55% average (up from 45-50%)
- **Subscriber retention rate:** 70%+ viewers return for new videos
- **Suggested traffic:** 40%+ views from YouTube recommendations (algorithm push)

**Content Signals:**
- **Top 10% identified:** Clear outliers performing 3x+ average
- **Pattern replication working:** New videos matching top performer metrics
- **Audience overlap maintained:** 80%+ shared viewers across videos
- **Session time increasing:** Average session >30 minutes (bingeability)

**What "success" looks like at end of Improvement:**
- ✅ 5K-10K subscribers (significant audience base)
- ✅ Predictable performance (can forecast views based on patterns)
- ✅ Quality increase visible (CTR and AVD improving)
- ✅ Formula Playbook documented (replicable success patterns)
- ✅ Sustainable pace maintained (not burned out)

**What to do if CTR/AVD not improving:**
- Study competitors in niche (what are they doing differently?)
- Request feedback from engaged community (what would improve quality?)
- Test more dramatic thumbnail/title variations (incremental changes may not move needle)
- Consider professional thumbnail designer (production quality matters)
- Review hook scripts (first 30 seconds may be weak)

---

## Phase 3: Optimization (Months 9-12)

### Primary Goal
**Systematic replication of proven winners, reach 50K-100K subscribers**

Formula is working. Now scale what works, reduce variance, compound growth.

---

### Publishing Cadence

**Strategic: 1x per week or bi-weekly based on data**

**Publishing day:** Monday, 8:00 AM EST (or when video ready)

**Rationale:**
- **Quality always > arbitrary cadence:** If video needs extra week, take it
- **Audience loyalty allows flexibility:** 5K+ subscriber base returns regardless of perfect schedule
- **Focus on hits:** Better 1 exceptional video/month than 4 mediocre
- **Strategic timing:** Can align with events, trends, launches when beneficial

**Flexibility guidelines:**
- If video performance consistently strong: Maintain 1x/week
- If quality suffering from pace: Move to bi-weekly
- If experimenting with high-production video: Allow 2-3 week production time
- Can burst to 2x/week if batch-produced content ready

**Minimum cadence:** 1 video per 2 weeks (maintain algorithmic presence without sacrificing quality)

---

### Content Focus

**Proven Formats Dominate**

**Bucket Distribution:**
- **70% Bucket A** (proven discovery formats) - 11-14 videos
- **25% Bucket B** (authority building) - 4-5 videos
- **5% Bucket C** (loyalty driver) - 1 video

**Rationale:**
- **Bucket A:** Scale winners (sniper approach perfected)
- **Bucket B:** Increase premium positioning (thought leadership)
- **Bucket C:** Superfan community (high engagement, acceptable low views)

**Content selection strategy:**

**Bucket A (Tutorial Content):**
- **80% proven winners:** Replicate top 10% formats systematically
- **15% adjacent expansion:** Test related topics maintaining 80% overlap
- **5% experimentation:** High-risk bets with learning goal

**Systematic replication:**
1. Identify top 3 performing videos from Months 1-8
2. Analyze what made them successful (title, thumbnail, hook, format, topic)
3. Create variations: Different workflow, same format
4. Example: If "Building Content Calendar" performed best, create:
   - "Building Email Automation System" (same build format)
   - "Building Client Reporting Dashboard" (same demonstration style)
   - "Building Lead Magnet Generator" (same systematic approach)

**Adjacent expansion (maintain 80% overlap):**
- If core audience = marketers building AI systems, expand to:
  - Solopreneurs building business infrastructure
  - Content creators building distribution systems
  - Agency founders building client delivery systems
- Test expansion carefully (monitor audience overlap metrics)
- Pull back if overlap drops below 75%

**Bucket B (Framework Content):**
- Thought leadership establishing category authority
- Philosophical depth differentiating from tutorial-only channels
- Shareable in professional contexts (conference talks, LinkedIn articles)

**Bucket C (Building in Public):**
- Monthly community updates (reduce to sustainable cadence)
- Show major breakthroughs or challenges only (episodic not weekly)
- Deep engagement valued over view count

---

### Packaging Standards

**Data-Driven Optimization Only**

By Month 9, you have 40-50 videos of performance data. Use it.

**Title Optimization:**
- Start with proven formulas from top performers
- Generate 20-30 variations (less than Improvement, more focused)
- Select variation most similar to historical winners
- A/B test only if initial performance weak

**Thumbnail Optimization:**
- Use templates that consistently perform (known winners)
- Replicate aesthetic of top-performing thumbnails
- Create 2-3 variations (less experimentation, more refinement)
- Swap only if CTR significantly below benchmark

**Hook Optimization:**
- Use hook structures from videos with 60%+ retention at 30-second mark
- Script 1-2 variations maximum (proven patterns only)
- Less experimentation, more consistency

**Performance Benchmarking:**

Establish benchmarks from top 10% performers:
- **CTR benchmark:** Average of top 10% videos (likely 7-9%)
- **AVD benchmark:** Average of top 10% videos (likely 55-60%)
- **Subscriber conversion:** Average new subs per top 10% video (likely 50-100 per video)

**Only deviate from proven formulas if:**
- Testing strategic expansion (new audience segment)
- Experimenting with high-upside format (20% experimental)
- Responding to trend or timely opportunity

**Otherwise:** Replicate what works. Consistency compounds.

---

- ✅ 20K-50K subscribers (category authority)
- ✅ Predictable growth (sustainable trajectory)
- ✅ Formula mastered (replicable hits)
- ✅ Community established (superfan base)
- ✅ Monetization viable (if pursued)

**What to do if growth plateaus:**
- Expand adjacent niches (carefully, monitor overlap)
- Increase Bucket B thought leadership (broader appeal)
- Collaborate with complementary creators (cross-promotion)
- Experiment with new formats (20% experimental allocation)
- Consider paid promotion of top performers (amplify winners)

---

## Phase Transition Criteria

### When to Move from Establishment to Improvement

**Required indicators (all must be true):**
- ✅ 1K+ subscribers achieved
- ✅ 24+ videos published (16+ weeks consistent)
- ✅ Production pipeline sustainable (team not burned out)
- ✅ Top 10% performers clearly identified (2-3 standout videos)

**Recommended timing:** Start of Month 5 (after 4 full months of 2x/week)

**What if behind on subscribers?**
- If at 500-900 subscribers by Month 4 end, still transition to Improvement
- 1K is guideline, not hard requirement
- Focus on quality improvement will accelerate growth
- Don't stay in 2x/week indefinitely if burning out

---

### When to Move from Improvement to Optimization

**Required indicators (all must be true):**
- ✅ 5K+ subscribers (strong audience base)
- ✅ Clear patterns identified (know what works)
- ✅ Consistent performance (top performers replicable)
- ✅ Formula Playbook documented (patterns written down)

**Recommended timing:** Start of Month 9 (after 4 months of 1x/week quality focus)

**What if behind on subscribers?**
- If at 2K-4K subscribers by Month 8 end, can still transition
- Focus shifts from subscriber count to performance consistency
- Optimization is about scaling what works (not forcing growth)
- If patterns unclear, stay in Improvement longer (3-6 more months)

---

### What If You Need to Slow Down?

**It's OK to adjust cadence based on team capacity.**

**Acceptable adjustments:**

**During Establishment:**
- Start at 1x/week instead of 2x/week if team overwhelmed
- Takes longer to reach 1K subs, but sustainable pace more important
- Extend Establishment to 6-8 months instead of 4

**During Improvement:**
- Move to bi-weekly if weekly too demanding
- Focus on quality over frequency
- Better 2 great videos/month than 4 mediocre

**During Optimization:**
- Monthly videos acceptable if quality exceptional
- Loyal audience will wait for quality
- Can maintain growth with 12-16 videos/year if each is exceptional

**Remember:** Burnout kills channels more than slow growth. Sustainable pace always wins long-term.

## Content Calendar Integration

### Monthly Rhythm Across All Phases

**Week 1: Strategy & Ideation**
- Monday: Review previous month performance (analytics deep dive)
- Tuesday: Ideation session (100+ ideas generated)
- Wednesday: Topic validation (keyword research, audience fit)
- Thursday: Select next 4 video topics (monthly roadmap)
- Friday: Begin production on Video 1

**Week 2: Production & Publishing**
- Monday: Publish Video 1 (8:00 AM EST)
- Monday afternoon: Monitor first 24 hours (CTR, early retention)
- Tuesday-Wednesday: Film Video 2
- Thursday: Publish Video 2 (if 2x/week cadence) OR edit Video 2 (if 1x/week)
- Friday: Begin Video 3 pre-production

**Week 3: Iteration & Batch Production**
- Monday: Publish Video 3 (or Video 2 if 1x/week)
- Tuesday: A/B test adjustments (swap thumbnails/titles if needed)
- Wednesday-Thursday: Batch film Videos 4-5
- Friday: Edit Video 4

**Week 4: Buffer & Optimization**
- Monday: Publish Video 4 (or Video 3 if 1x/week)
- Tuesday-Thursday: Edit Video 5, build 1-week buffer
- Friday: Monthly review (performance patterns, learnings documentation)

**This rhythm maintains:**
- Consistent upload schedule (audience expectation)
- 1-week production buffer (reduces stress)
- Regular analytics review (data-driven decisions)
- Sustainable workload (prevents burnout)

---

### Seasonal Considerations

**Marketing industry has cyclical patterns. Align content when beneficial.**

**Q1 (Jan-Mar): Planning Season**
- Marketers setting annual strategy
- Content focus: Strategic frameworks, annual planning systems
- Higher receptivity to "build infrastructure" message

**Q2 (Apr-Jun): Execution Season**
- Implementing Q1 plans
- Content focus: Workflow tutorials, practical systems
- Higher search volume for "how to build X"

**Q3 (Jul-Sep): Optimization Season**
- Mid-year reviews, process improvement
- Content focus: Advanced techniques, scaling workflows
- Higher interest in efficiency and automation

**Q4 (Oct-Dec): Year-End + Holiday Slowdown**
- Reflection, planning for next year
- Content focus: Year-in-review, lessons learned, Building in Public updates
- Lower views expected (account for in expectations)

**Don't over-optimize for seasonality in first year.** Focus on consistency. By Year 2, can strategically time content releases.

---

## Research Foundation

This publishing strategy synthesizes:
- **Paddy Galloway 3-Phase Framework:** Establishment (volume) → Improvement (quality) → Optimization (scale)
- **YouTube Algorithm Principles:** Consistency signals, quality improvements, catalog depth
- **Team Capacity Analysis:** 2-person team, 7-8/10 technical depth, batch production capability
- **Sustainable Growth Philosophy:** Burnout prevention, long-term pace over short-term gains

**Strategic Confidence:** Very High (90%)—phase-based approach proven across successful channels, adapted to Marketing Architecture positioning and team capacity constraints.

---

## Quick Reference: Phase Comparison

| Phase | Duration | Cadence | Focus | Goal | Success Metric |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Establishment** | Months 1-4 | 2x/week | Volume & skill building | 1K subs | Consistency maintained |
| **Improvement** | Months 5-8 | 1x/week | Quality & iteration | 10K subs | CTR/AVD improvement |
| **Optimization** | Months 9-12 | Strategic | Replication & scale | 50K subs | Predictable performance |

**Key Takeaway:** Each phase builds on previous. Can't skip Establishment (need catalog + data). Can't skip Improvement (need patterns identified). Optimization only works when formula is proven.
