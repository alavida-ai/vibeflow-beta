# Launch Sequence: First 8-12 Video Roadmap

**Phase:** 3 - Launch Strategy & Publishing Cadence
**Created:** 2025-11-13
**Status:** Production-Ready Launch Plan

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap strategically sequences the first 8-12 videos to maximize channel growth through algorithmic discovery, catalog depth, and audience bingeability. Sequencing prioritizes zero-competition keywords first, builds technical credibility systematically, and creates cross-linking opportunities that increase session time.

**Core Strategy:**
- **Videos 1-4:** Foundation layer (category definition + technical credibility)
- **Videos 5-8:** Workflow expansion (high-demand pain points + framework introduction)
- **Videos 9-12:** Strategic diversification (community launch + advanced topics)

**Success Metrics:** 1K subscribers by Month 2, 50%+ AVD, 80%+ audience overlap between videos

---

## Part 1: Launch Rationale

### Why This Order Matters

**1. Algorithm Signals: Front-Load Discovery Content**

YouTube's algorithm tests new channels aggressively in the first 10-20 videos. Zero-competition keywords in Videos 1-2 provide the cleanest algorithmic signal:
- High CTR (no competition = clear positioning)
- Strong AVD (technical depth = engaged viewers)
- External traffic (Google search drives YouTube recommendations)

**Strategic Logic:** Establish searchability first, retain viewers second, expand third.

---

**2. Foundation-Building Approach: Establish Before Expanding**

Videos 1-4 create the category foundation:
- **Video 1:** Defines category ("Claude Code for marketers")
- **Video 2:** Demonstrates practical value (content calendar = daily pain point)
- **Video 3:** Captures comparison traffic (ChatGPT vs Claude)
- **Video 4:** Shows advanced capability (multi-agent systems = differentiation)

This progression = "This category exists → It solves your problems → It's better than alternatives → It's more powerful than you think"

**Psychological Arc:** Accessibility → Capability → Differentiation → Aspiration

---

**3. Discovery Optimization: Search-Friendly Content Front-Loaded**

First 6 videos target zero or low-competition keywords:
1. "Claude Code for marketing automation" (ZERO competition)
2. "Claude for content creation" (HIGH demand, MEDIUM competition)
3. "Claude vs ChatGPT for marketing" (HIGH search volume)
4. "Build AI marketing agent Claude Code" (LOW competition)
5. "Claude Code SEO automation" (HIGH demand, LOW-MEDIUM competition)
6. "ChatGPT for marketing" intercept (HIGH volume positioning)

**Strategic Result:** Each video is a discovery engine feeding new viewers into the channel. By Video 8, we have 6 search-optimized entry points.

---

**4. Audience Retention Strategy: Sequencing Creates Bingeability**

Cross-linking strategy creates intentional viewer journeys:

**Journey 1: Beginner Path**
Video 1 (Setup) → Video 2 (Content Calendar) → Video 7 (Brand Voice Framework) → Video 6 (ChatGPT comparison)

**Journey 2: Advanced Builder Path**
Video 1 (Setup) → Video 4 (Multi-Agent) → Video 5 (SEO System) → Video 8 (Economics framework)

**Journey 3: Philosophy-First Path**
Video 3 (Comparison) → Video 8 (Real Cost) → Video 1 (Setup) → Video 4 (Multi-Agent)

**Strategic Result:** Every video has 2-3 logical "next video" recommendations, creating session time > 30 minutes.

---

### Foundation-Building Approach

**The Staircase Strategy:**

```
Video 1: Setup (Accessibility)
    ↓ "Now let's build something practical"
Video 2: Content Calendar (Immediate Value)
    ↓ "Here's why this beats alternatives"
Video 3: Claude vs ChatGPT (Differentiation)
    ↓ "Here's how to build advanced systems"
Video 4: Multi-Agent System (Aspiration)
    ↓ "Here's another high-value workflow"
Video 5: SEO Automation (Pain Point Solution)
    ↓ "Here's the philosophical foundation"
Video 7-8: Framework Content (Thought Leadership)
```

Each step builds on previous foundation. New viewers entering at any point find logical backlog to explore.

---

### Discovery Optimization

**Front-Loading Strategy:**

- **Videos 1-6:** All Bucket A (80% discovery focus)
- **Video 7-8:** Introduce Bucket B (15% retention focus)
- **Video 10:** Launch Bucket C (5% community focus)

**Why This Timing:**
- Month 1-2: Prioritize discovery (algorithm learning phase)
- Month 2-3: Introduce frameworks (retain early subscribers)
- Month 3: Launch community series (convert subscribers to superfans)

**Keyword Coverage by Video 8:**
- 6 zero or low-competition keywords owned
- 2 high-volume comparison keywords intercepted
- 8 entry points for new viewer discovery

---

### Bingeability Through Cross-Linking

**The 80% Overlap Maintenance:**

All videos reference "Marketing Architect" transformation consistently:
- Same vocabulary (systems, workflows, infrastructure, ownership)
- Same philosophy (capability over convenience, build don't rent)
- Same technical environment (Claude Code ecosystem)
- Same positioning (AI augments human expertise)

**Cross-Reference Strategy:**

Every Bucket A tutorial:
- References relevant Bucket B framework
- Links to Setup video for new viewers
- Connects to related workflow tutorials

Every Bucket B framework:
- Shows application in Bucket A tutorial
- Builds on previous framework concepts
- Creates curiosity for technical implementation

**Result:** Viewer who watches any 3 videos receives consistent message, sees 80%+ thematic overlap, feels channel coherence.

### Publishing Days & Times

**Optimal Publishing Schedule:**

- **Avoid:** Saturday/Sunday (lower B2B marketing traffic)

- [ ] Video uploaded as unlisted (processing complete)
- [ ] 3 thumbnail variations ready (A/B test prepared)
- [ ] Title finalized (top scoring variation)
- [ ] Description written (cross-links, timestamps, keywords)
- [ ] End screens configured (2 video recommendations)
- [ ] Cards added (mid-roll cross-promotion)
- [ ] Pinned comment drafted (community engagement + cross-link)
- [ ] Social posts scheduled (X/Twitter thread prepared)

## Packaging Finalization Workflow

### Title Finalization (Per Video)

**Step 1: Generate 30-40 variations (30 minutes)**
- Use formulas from Bucket A/B/C
- Mix formats (questions, statements, comparisons)
- Vary length and power words

**Step 2: Score each variation (20 minutes)**
- Curiosity (1-10)
- Clarity (1-10)
- Brand Fit (1-10)
- Searchability (1-10)
- **Select top 3** (score 35+)

**Step 3: Primary + A/B test backup**
- Upload with highest-scoring title
- Prepare variations #2 and #3 for testing if CTR < 5%

---

### Thumbnail Creation (Per Video)

**Step 1: Create 3 distinct variations (2 hours)**
- Use bucket-appropriate templates (Interface + Result, Speaker + Framework, etc.)
- Ensure high contrast and readability at 100x100px
- Text overlay max 5-7 words

**Step 2: Glance test**
- Shrink to mobile size
- Must comprehend in <1 second
- Verify text legibility

**Step 3: Upload all 3**
- Test variation #1 first
- Swap after 24 hours if CTR underperforms

---

### Hook Scripting (Per Video)

**Step 1: Script 0-7 second confirmation**
- Show thumbnail element
- State topic directly
- Confirm click decision

**Step 2: Script 8-30 second curiosity**
- Add new information
- Create stakes or pattern interrupt
- Preview learning journey

**Step 3: Time execution**
- Must be <35 seconds total
- Record multiple takes
- Select highest energy delivery
