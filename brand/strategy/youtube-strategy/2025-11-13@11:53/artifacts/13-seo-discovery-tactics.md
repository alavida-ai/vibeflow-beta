# Artifact 13: SEO/Discovery Tactics

**Objective:** Optimize for YouTube search and suggested video algorithms to maximize discovery.

---

## Part 1: Keyword Research Integration

### YouTube SEO Reality (Post-2007 Algorithm)

**What YouTube actually prioritizes:**
1. **Viewer satisfaction signals:** CTR, watch time, retention
2. **Titles and descriptions:** Natural language, human-first
3. **Engagement metrics:** Likes, comments, shares
4. **Recent uploads:** Slight recency bonus (not dominant)

**What YouTube ignores:**
1. **Keyword stuffing:** Manipulation tactics penalized
2. **Tag spam:** Minimal impact on discovery
3. **Exact match requirements:** Algorithm understands intent and synonyms

**Strategic implication:** Write for humans first (drives CTR), incorporate keywords naturally (aids discovery).

---

### Primary Keyword Identification

**Sources for keyword research:**
1. **YouTube autocomplete:** Type core topic, note suggested completions
2. **Competitor video analysis:** What keywords do top-performing videos use?
3. **Phase 1 keyword validation:** Reference validated ZERO competition keywords from competitive research
4. **Long-tail variations:** Question-based searches ("how to," "what is," "why does")

**For Marketing Architects:**
- **Core keywords:** "Claude Code," "marketing automation," "self-hosted AI," "MCP servers"
- **ZERO competition keywords:** "Claude Code for marketers," "self-hosted marketing infrastructure," "AI marketing without subscriptions"
- **Long-tail opportunities:** "How to build marketing systems with Claude Code," "Self-hosted alternative to marketing SaaS"

---

### Primary Keyword Placement (Critical)

**1. Title: Front-load (first 3-5 words)**
- ✅ "Claude Code Marketing Research: 80% Time Reduction"
- ❌ "How I Reduced Research Time by 80% Using Claude Code"
- **Why:** Algorithm and humans both scan left-to-right, front-loading maximizes visibility

**2. Description: First sentence + first paragraph**
- First 2-3 lines appear before "Show more" click
- Must include primary keyword naturally
- Should entice click on "Show more" for full value

**Example:**
```
This video walks through building a self-hosted marketing research system
in Claude Code that generates 10-page reports with verified citations in
under 15 minutes. I'll show you the MCP server integration, Firecrawl
web scraping setup, and Perplexity verification workflow.

[Full description continues after "Show more"...]
```

**3. Tags: First tag = primary keyword**
- Tag 1: Exact primary keyword ("Claude Code marketing")
- Tags 2-5: Related variations ("marketing automation," "self-hosted AI")
- Tags 6-10: Broader category ("AI marketing," "marketing systems")

**4. File name: Before upload**
- Rename video file before uploading
- Format: `primary-keyword-secondary-keyword.mp4`
- Example: `claude-code-marketing-research-system.mp4`
- **Why:** File metadata influences initial categorization

---

### Secondary Keyword Placement

**Description: Naturally throughout**
- Weave 3-5 secondary keywords into description paragraphs
- Focus on natural language, not forced insertion
- Use synonyms and related terms (algorithm understands relationships)

**Example secondary keywords for "Claude Code marketing" video:**
- "Multi-agent workflows"
- "Self-hosted AI infrastructure"
- "Marketing orchestration"
- "Docker-deployed systems"
- "MCP server integration"

**Tags: 2-5 additional tags**
- Related technologies mentioned in video
- Adjacent search terms
- Category tags

**Chapters: Chapter titles (if used)**
- YouTube chapters appear in search results
- Include keywords in chapter titles naturally
- Example: "0:00 - Introduction," "2:15 - Claude Code Setup," "8:30 - MCP Integration"

---

### Long-Tail Keyword Strategy

**What are long-tail keywords?**
- Longer, more specific search phrases
- Lower competition, niche audience
- Higher intent (searcher knows exactly what they want)

**Examples:**
- **Broad (high competition):** "Marketing automation" (millions of videos)
- **Long-tail (lower competition):** "How to automate marketing research with Claude Code" (dozens of videos)

**Strategy for Marketing Architects:**
- Rank for long-tail first (easier to win position 1-3)
- Broad keywords benefit from spillover (high-quality signals)
- Build authority in niche before competing in broad terms

**How to find long-tail opportunities:**
1. **YouTube search bar:** Type primary keyword, note autocomplete suggestions
2. **Related searches:** Scroll to bottom of search results, see "Related searches"
3. **Question-based formats:** "How to," "What is," "Why does," "When should"
4. **Technology combinations:** "Claude Code + Firecrawl," "Docker + MCP servers"

**Long-tail targeting in titles:**
- Use natural question format: "How to Build Self-Hosted Marketing Infrastructure with Docker"
- Include technology stack: "Claude Code + Firecrawl for Marketing Research: Complete Guide"
- Address specific pain points: "Building AI Marketing Systems That Don't Produce Slop"

### Description Example: Bucket A (Claude Code Tutorial)

**Video:** "Building Multi-Agent Content System in Claude Code: 30 Tweets Per Week"

```
In this video, I'm building a multi-agent content system in Claude Code
that generates 30 on-brand tweets per week without AI slop. I'll walk
through the exact agent architecture, the prompt engineering approach,
and the human-in-loop quality control system that ensures brand voice.

By the end, you'll see how to design specialist agents (research,
drafting, editing), orchestrate multi-agent workflows in Claude Code,
and implement verification layers that catch off-brand content. This
system has been running for 3 months and completely replaced my content
calendar SaaS subscriptions.

### Description Example: Bucket B (Educational Framework)

**Video:** "Why Your Marketing Stack Should Be Self-Hosted: The Case for Ownership"

```
In this video, I'm explaining why marketing infrastructure ownership is
the strategic advantage SaaS subscriptions can't provide. I'll break down
the economics of per-seat pricing, show the hidden costs of vendor lock-in,
and present the infrastructure ownership ladder from renting to building.

You'll learn the total cost of ownership calculation (including maintenance),
the strategic flexibility that comes from controlling your own infrastructure,
and how to evaluate build vs. buy decisions for marketing systems. This isn't
anti-SaaS ideology—it's evidence-based analysis of when ownership beats renting.

### Tag Strategy Rules

**Do:**
- ✅ Use 10-15 tags (diminishing returns beyond this)
- ✅ Mix broad and specific terms
- ✅ Include primary keyword as first tag
- ✅ Add brand tags for channel identity
- ✅ Update tags if video underperforms in search

**Don't:**
- ❌ Stuff 30+ tags (algorithm penalizes over-optimization)
- ❌ Use irrelevant tags (confuses categorization)
- ❌ Repeat same tags on every video (missed niche opportunities)
- ❌ Use competitor channel names (violation, gets penalized)
- ❌ Ignore tags entirely (missed search opportunity)

---

## Part 4: Suggested Video Optimization

### End Screens (Last 5-20 Seconds)

**Purpose:** Direct viewers to next video, maximize session time

**Element 1: Best-Performing Related Video (Primary)**
- Choose video with highest watch time (not just views)
- Should be related topic (keeps viewer in content journey)
- Updates dynamically if using "Best for viewer" option

**Element 2: Playlist (Secondary)**
- Create curated learning paths (Bucket A: Claude Code tutorials)
- Binge-watching incentive (playlist suggests next video automatically)
- Organize by topic: "Building in Public," "Marketing Systems 101," "Claude Code Tutorials"

**Element 3: Subscribe Button (Always)**
- Standard CTA, always include
- Positioned in corner, doesn't obscure content

**End screen timing:**
- **Videos under 10 min:** 5-10 second end screen
- **Videos 10-20 min:** 10-15 second end screen
- **Videos 20+ min:** 15-20 second end screen

**End screen best practices:**
- Don't end video abruptly (give verbal CTA: "If you want to see X next, watch this video")
- Leave clean visual space (no important content obscured)
- Test "Best for viewer" option (algorithm-selected video often outperforms manual)

---

### Cards (Mid-Roll Suggestions)

**Purpose:** Suggest related content at natural transition points

**When to use cards:**
- Reference to previous video ("As I showed in my video on X...")
- Transition between major sections ("Next, I'll show you Y, but if you want to understand Z first...")
- After demonstrating concept that has dedicated deep-dive video

**Card limits:**
- **Maximum 2 per video under 15 minutes** (don't overuse)
- **Maximum 3-4 per video over 15 minutes**
- More cards = diminishing returns + viewer annoyance

**Card timing best practices:**
- Place at natural pauses (not mid-sentence)
- Announce verbally ("I have a video on that, see the card")
- Test with analytics (do cards increase or decrease watch time?)

**Card types to use:**
- **Video cards:** Link to related video (most common)
- **Playlist cards:** Link to curated series
- Avoid poll cards or donation cards (low relevance for educational content)

---

### Playlists (Organizational Strategy)

**Purpose:** Create learning paths, increase binge-watching, improve SEO

**Playlist structure for Marketing Architects:**

**By Bucket (Content Type):**
1. **"Claude Code for Marketers"** - All Bucket A videos
2. **"Marketing Systems 101"** - All Bucket B videos
3. **"Building in Public"** - All Bucket C videos (episodic series)

**By Learning Path (Skill Progression):**
1. **"Start Here: Marketing Architecture Foundations"** - Intro videos for new viewers
2. **"Self-Hosted Infrastructure Guide"** - Complete setup sequence
3. **"Advanced Multi-Agent Systems"** - Deep technical content

**By Technology:**
1. **"Claude Code Tutorials"** - All Claude Code-focused videos
2. **"MCP Server Integration"** - MCP-specific content
3. **"Docker for Marketers"** - Self-hosting technical guides

**Playlist SEO optimization:**
- **Title includes keywords:** "Claude Code for Marketing: Complete Tutorial Series"
- **Description optimized:** Same principles as video descriptions
- **Thumbnail consistency:** First video thumbnail becomes playlist thumbnail (choose strategically)
- **Regular updates:** Add new videos immediately (keeps playlist fresh in algorithm)

**Playlist analytics to monitor:**
- Playlist watch time (are viewers binging?)
- Drop-off points (where do viewers leave the playlist?)
- Top traffic sources (how are viewers finding playlists?)

---

## Part 5: 80% Overlap Strategy

### Maintaining Audience Cohesion

**What is 80% overlap?**
- Target: 80%+ of viewers watch multiple videos on your channel
- Indicator of strong niche positioning and audience loyalty
- Algorithm rewards channels with high session time (multi-video views)

**How to achieve 80% overlap:**

**1. Consistent vocabulary across videos**
- Use same terminology (e.g., "Marketing Architect," "infrastructure ownership," "human-in-loop")
- Reinforce core concepts (ownership over renting, systems over tactics)
- Avoid terminology drift (don't call same thing different names)

**2. Cross-referencing between videos**
- "As I showed in my video on X..." (verbal + card link)
- "If you haven't watched Y yet, start there" (creates prerequisite path)
- "Next week, I'll show you Z" (teases upcoming content)

**3. Series formatting (Building in Public)**
- Episodic structure with clear numbering (Ep. 1, Ep. 2, etc.)
- Ongoing narrative (progress updates, continued projects)
- Loyal viewers return for next episode

**4. Thematic coherence (All videos reinforce positioning)**
- Every video supports "Marketing Architects" identity
- Consistent contrarian positioning (challenge SaaS, champion ownership)
- Philosophical through-line (systems thinking, infrastructure independence)

---

### Monitoring Audience Overlap in YouTube Studio

**Where to find data:**
1. YouTube Studio → Analytics → Audience tab
2. Scroll to "Top videos" section
3. Look for "% of viewers who watched more than one video"

**Benchmarks:**
- **Below 50%:** Low overlap, audience not cohesive (content too scattered)
- **50-70%:** Moderate overlap, niche defined but room to tighten
- **70-85%:** Strong overlap, loyal audience, clear positioning
- **85%+:** Exceptional, viewers binge your content

**If overlap is low (<50%), diagnose:**
- Are video topics too diverse? (Tighten niche focus)
- Is packaging misleading? (Attracting wrong audience)
- Is content quality inconsistent? (Some videos underdeliver on promise)
- Are you cross-referencing enough? (Suggest related videos verbally)

---

### Suggested Video Traffic Sources

**Monitor in YouTube Studio:**
1. Analytics → Reach tab → Traffic source types
2. Check "Suggested videos" percentage

**Goal:** 30-50% of views from suggested videos (strong signal of algorithmic favor)

**How to increase suggested video traffic:**

**1. Create strong video pairs (A → B watching pattern)**
- After Bucket A tutorial, suggest related Bucket B framework
- After contrarian positioning video, suggest technical implementation
- After Building in Public episode, suggest deep-dive on specific learning

**2. Optimize for watch time (not just CTR)**
- Algorithm suggests videos that keep viewers watching
- High retention = more suggested video placements
- Test packaging-content alignment (does CTR lead to watch time?)

**3. Consistent upload schedule (algorithm rewards consistency)**
- Pick cadence and stick to it (2x/week → 1x/week → strategic)
- Viewers return expecting new content
- Algorithm recognizes pattern, boosts distribution

**4. Engage with comments (signals community)**
- Reply to thoughtful comments (shows active creator)
- Pin top comment (highlights best engagement)
- Heart valuable feedback (acknowledges viewer contribution)

---

### Session Time Optimization (Multi-Video Views)

**What is session time?**
- Total time viewer spends on YouTube in one sitting
- Algorithm rewards channels that contribute to long sessions
- Multi-video views = high session time contribution

**Tactics to increase session time:**

**1. End screens with compelling next video**
- Tease next video verbally: "In the next video, I'll show you how to..."
- Choose high-watch-time videos (not just high view count)
- Update end screens regularly (test different video pairs)

**2. Mid-roll cards at natural transitions**
- "Before I show you X, you need to understand Y—see the card"
- Gives viewer permission to pause current video, watch prerequisite, return

**3. Playlist binge strategy**
- Group sequential videos (Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3)
- YouTube auto-plays next video in playlist
- Session time increases passively

**4. Hook references future content**
- "This is the foundation—next week I'll show you the advanced version"
- Creates return intent (viewer bookmarks channel)
- Long-term session time contribution

---

## Part 6: SEO Iteration and Testing

### What to Test

**Test 1: Title variations (A/B test)**
- Keyword front-loaded vs. curiosity-first
- Which drives more search traffic over 30 days?

**Test 2: Description length**
- Short description (2 paragraphs) vs. long description (5 paragraphs)
- Does more context improve search ranking?

**Test 3: Tag relevance**
- Broad tags vs. niche-specific tags
- Which approach ranks better for target keywords?

**Test 4: Thumbnail-title synergy**
- Test if search traffic increases when thumbnail + title are highly aligned vs. complementary

---

### Monitoring Search Performance

**YouTube Studio → Traffic Source → YouTube Search:**
- **Top search terms:** What keywords bring viewers to this video?
- **Impressions:** How often does video appear in search results?
- **CTR from search:** Are searchers clicking when they see your video?
- **Watch time from search:** Are search viewers watching longer? (signals relevance)

**What success looks like:**
- Video appears in top 10 for primary keyword within 14 days
- CTR from search >10% (highly relevant to search intent)
- Watch time from search >50% (video delivers on search promise)
- Sustained search traffic over 30+ days (evergreen content)

---

### When to Optimize After Launch

**Week 1: Monitor, don't change**
- Let algorithm gather initial data
- Track CTR, retention, search impressions
- Note which keywords drive traffic

**Week 2: First optimization (if needed)**
- If search traffic underperforms:
  - Adjust title to front-load primary keyword
  - Add missing keywords to description
  - Update tags to include actual search terms driving traffic

**Week 3-4: Second optimization (if needed)**
- If CTR low from search:
  - Test alternative thumbnail (aligned with search intent)
  - Revise title for clarity (remove ambiguity)

**Month 2+: Evergreen optimization**
- Update description with links to newer related videos
- Refresh thumbnail if it looks dated compared to newer content
- Add to playlists to boost discoverability

---

## Part 7: Brand Voice in SEO Content

### Balancing SEO and Brand Identity

**Core tension:** SEO requires keyword inclusion, brand voice requires distinctive language

**Resolution:** Integrate keywords naturally within brand-voice-compliant sentences

**Examples:**

**❌ SEO-optimized but brand voice violated:**
"Easy Claude Code tutorial for beginners: Simple marketing automation anyone can use"
- Problems: "Easy," "simple," "anyone can" (ease promises), "use" (tool-user framing)

**✅ SEO-optimized AND brand voice aligned:**
"Building Marketing Infrastructure with Claude Code: Self-Hosted Automation Guide"
- Keywords: "Claude Code," "marketing infrastructure," "automation"
- Brand voice: "Building" (ownership), "self-hosted" (independence), "guide" (educational authority)

---

**❌ Description with keyword stuffing:**
"This video shows you how to use Claude Code for marketing. Claude Code is great for marketing automation. Learn marketing automation with Claude Code."
- Problems: Repetitive, unnatural, obvious manipulation

**✅ Description with natural keyword integration:**
"This video walks through building a self-hosted marketing automation system in Claude Code. I'll show you the multi-agent architecture, MCP server integration, and Docker deployment process—everything you need to architect infrastructure you own, not rent."
- Keywords: "Claude Code," "marketing automation," "multi-agent," "MCP," "Docker"
- Brand voice: "Building," "architect," "own not rent" (ownership philosophy)

---

### SEO Content Voice Guidelines

**When writing titles, descriptions, tags:**
- ✅ Include keywords naturally (don't force awkward phrasing)
- ✅ Maintain active voice ("Build X" not "X can be built")
- ✅ Use ownership language ("Your infrastructure" not "The platform")
- ✅ Specific over generic ("30 tweets per week" not "more content")
- ✅ Systems thinking vocabulary ("Architecture," "infrastructure," "workflows")

**Prohibited even for SEO:**
- ❌ Hype language to attract clicks ("Amazing AI hack!")
- ❌ Ease promises for broader reach ("Easy for anyone!")
- ❌ Generic SaaS vendor language ("Leverage cutting-edge AI")
- ❌ Clickbait tactics ("You won't believe this!")

**Result:** SEO-optimized content that still sounds like Marketing Architects, not generic YouTube channel

---

**Strategy Status:** Production-ready
**Evidence Base:** YouTube youtube-seo-tactics.md, voice STRATEGY.md, Phase 1 competitive research
**Application:** All videos across Buckets A, B, C with consistent SEO methodology
