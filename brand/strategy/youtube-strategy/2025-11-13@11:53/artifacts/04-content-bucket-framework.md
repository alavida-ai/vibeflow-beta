- Format allows partial viewing (get tactical value without full system adoption)
- Workflow examples inspire without requiring full replication

**New Viewer Appeal (9/10):**
- Zero-competition keywords ("Claude Code for marketing automation," "Claude for content creation")
- High search volume on specific pain points (automation, content workflows, SEO)
- Technical specificity signals authority and differentiation
- Searchable titles naturally optimized for discovery

**Overall CCN Score: 8.0/10 (Excellent Growth Potential)**

**Growth Strategy:** This bucket is the discovery engine. High New viewer appeal drives algorithm recommendation, while Core/Casual retention prevents channel from becoming one-hit-wonder. 80% content allocation reflects discovery priority during Establishment phase.
