# OWWO Visual Assets Guidelines

**Created:** 2025-11-04
**Status:** Current Strategy (Active)

---

## Overview & Visual Philosophy

OWWO's visual identity is built on **confident simplicity with strategic boldness**. The brand combines a vibrant, energetic color palette with clean typography and sophisticated restraint in layout. This creates a distinctive positioning as a **creative studio that's approachably expert**—serious about craft and web3 knowledge, but human and accessible.

The visual system conveys four core qualities simultaneously: **professional** (through structure and client credibility), **playful** (through color and character), **creative** (through bold visual choices), and **innovative** (through web3-native positioning and forward-looking aesthetic).

## 1. Color Palette

### Primary Colors

#### Brand Yellow
- **Hex Code:** `#F7ED4A`
- **Usage:** Dominant hero backgrounds, large graphic elements, footer, text highlights
- **Strategic Role:** Brand signature color creating instant recognition and energy
- **Application:** Full-screen hero sections, major design features, key visual moments
- **Notes:** This is the single most important color—overuse is intentional and strategic

#### Pure Black
- **Hex Code:** `#000000`
- **Usage:** All body text, headlines, navigation, logo marks, CTAs, iconography
- **Strategic Role:** Maximum contrast, ensures readability and visual weight
- **Application:** Text elements, UI components, logo construction, borders
- **Notes:** Used consistently across all text applications for brand coherence

### Secondary Colors

#### Background Gray
- **Hex Code:** `#E8E8E8`
- **Usage:** Section backgrounds, card containers, content modules
- **Strategic Role:** Neutral foundation supporting content hierarchy
- **Application:** Backgrounds for information-dense sections
- **Notes:** Creates subtle visual layering without competing with primary colors

#### Secondary Gray (text/accents)
- **Hex Code:** `#C4C4C4`
- **Usage:** Supporting text, secondary labels, decorative elements
- **Strategic Role:** Hierarchy differentiation within text
- **Application:** Secondary headlines, captions, muted text elements
- **Notes:** Rarely used—black is preferred for main content

### Accent Colors (Strategic Use)

The following colors appear in imagery and team section cards only:
- **Dusty Pink:** `#D4A5AC` - Team member card backgrounds
- **Soft Purple:** `#A89FCC` - Team member card backgrounds, decorative accents
- **Turquoise:** `#75B8B8` - Team member card backgrounds, compositional support

**Important:** These accents are NOT primary brand colors—they exist in photography and team sections to add personality without compromising the bold yellow/black/gray system.

### Color Pairing Rules

**Primary Application:**
- Yellow + Black = **Highest contrast, primary brand moments** (hero, footer, key graphics)
- Yellow + Gray = **Secondary moments** with slightly reduced intensity
- Black + Gray = **Content-focused sections** where color recedes
- Accent colors + Yellow/Black = **Always subordinate** to primary palette

**Forbidden Pairings:**
- ❌ Avoid mixing accent colors (pink + purple + turquoise together)
- ❌ Avoid yellow text on light backgrounds
- ❌ Avoid reducing the visual weight of black typography
- ❌ Avoid introducing new colors beyond this defined palette

### Color Application Guidelines

| Context | Primary Color | Secondary Color | Rules |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Hero Sections | Yellow background | Black text/mark | 100% yellow coverage, centered content |
| Card Containers | Gray background | Black text | Consistent padding, rounded corners |
| Text Content | White/transparent | Black (H1-H3), Gray (secondary) | Black for all primary text |
| CTA Buttons | Black background | White text | Solid black, no variations |
| Iconography | Black strokes | Yellow accents | Bold line weight, clear visibility |
| Footer | Yellow background | Black text/mark | Consistent with hero treatment |

## 2. Typography System

See [typography analysis](artifacts/02b-typography.md) for detailed specifications.

### Font Families

**Primary Display Font:** Geometric rounded sans-serif (likely Circular or equivalent)
- **Usage:** Headlines, hero statements, service titles, major messaging

- **Characteristics:** Open apertures, consistent stroke, excellent readability

**Tertiary Monospace Font:** Fixed-width monospace
- **Usage:** Strategic labels, taglines, section headers
- **Weight Range:** Regular (400)
- **Characteristics:** Technical aesthetic, uppercase styling
- **Examples:** "CREATIVITY OPTIMIZED FOR WEB3 GROWTH", "SENIOR CRAFT", "WEB3 NATIVE"

- ✅ Stack headlines for dramatic scale effect

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Never use colored text except black or gray

### Visual Motifs

**Circles:** The dominant geometric form throughout the brand

- Used in composition and spacing
- Rounded corner treatment on all cards and containers

**Icons:** Derived from logo elements

## 4. Composition & Layout

See [composition analysis](artifacts/02d-composition-layout.md) for detailed specifications.

### Grid & Layout System

**Primary Grid:** 12-column responsive system
- **Desktop:** 2-3 column layouts with flexible column widths
- **Responsive:** Collapses to single column on mobile
- **Viewport Margins:** 5-8% on all sides, content never touches edges
- **Gutter Width:** Consistent horizontal spacing between columns (40-50px estimated)

**Layout Patterns:**

| Pattern | Usage | Structure | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Hero Section | Primary messaging, visual moments | Full-width colored background, centered content | Alternates with content sections |
| Card Grid | Services, team members | 2-3 column grid with equal widths | Consistent padding and rounded corners |
| Content Block | Information organization | Flexible column layout with text + image | Supports various content combinations |
| Footer | Site navigation, contact info | Multi-column grid with comprehensive information | Consistent with overall spacing |

### Spacing System

**Macro Spacing (between sections):**
- Large vertical gaps: 80-120px between major content blocks
- Full-height hero sections create breathing moments
- Color changes reinforce section boundaries

**Micro Spacing (within elements):**
- Card interior padding: 40-50px
- Text line-height: Generous (1.5-1.6)
- Element separation: Clear gaps between headings, paragraphs, lists
- Consistent baseline grid maintaining vertical rhythm

**Vertical Rhythm:**
- Consistent spacing between elements follows predictable pattern
- Section boundaries marked by color changes and whitespace
- No cramped or tight layouts—space is strategic, not accidental

### Composition Principles

**Balance:** Balanced asymmetry
- Off-center focal points with careful counterweights
- Not perfectly symmetrical but feels intentional and planned
- Whitespace used to balance visual weight

**Focal Points:** Multiple techniques create hierarchy
- Scale contrast: Large elements draw attention
- Color isolation: Yellow on gray creates emphasis
- Directional cues: Arrows and visual flow guide reading
- Proximity: Grouped elements form focal zones

**Reading Order:** Clear F-pattern and Z-pattern flow
- Natural progression through page content
- Hierarchy through size and positioning
- Call-to-action placement guides user attention

**Scroll Narrative:** Cinematic progression through sections
- Each section tells part of a story
- Alternates between immersive moments (yellow) and informational blocks
- Creates rhythmic scroll experience rather than flat list

### Layout Application Guidelines

**Dos:**
- ✅ Maintain generous whitespace as design element
- ✅ Use full-height hero sections for visual impact
- ✅ Alternate between hero moments and content sections
- ✅ Apply consistent padding to all card containers
- ✅ Use color changes to mark section boundaries

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Never create cramped layouts or squeeze content
- ❌ Never remove whitespace to fit more content
- ❌ Never break the grid system for decorative purposes
- ❌ Never create visual clutter or competing focal points
- ❌ Never use complex multi-level nesting of elements

## Summary

OWWO's visual system is **opinionated, consistent, and distinctive**. It works because every element serves a strategic purpose: the yellow creates energy and recognition, the black provides confidence and readability, the circles create visual coherence, and the generous whitespace provides breathing room for content to shine.

Use this system to maintain brand identity while allowing flexibility within these core principles.
