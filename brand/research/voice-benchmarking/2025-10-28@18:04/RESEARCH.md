## 7. Channel Adaptations

### Consistent Elements
All brands maintain these across channels:

## Notes & Limitations

**Research Scope:**
- Direct X/Twitter scraping unavailable; social samples from embedded content/articles
- Analysis represents snapshot from October 2025; voices may evolve
- Sample selection focused on variety of contexts for representativeness

**Caveats:**

## Next Steps

This research provides the foundation for brand voice strategy synthesis. Strategic recommendations and brand-specific voice guidelines will be developed during strategy synthesis phase, which will reference these findings as evidence base.
