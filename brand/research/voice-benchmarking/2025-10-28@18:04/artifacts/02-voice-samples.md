>
> Anjunadeep has introduced the world to artists like **Lane 8**, **Yotto** and **Dusky**, and released albums from **Tinlicker**, **Ben Böhmer**, **Eli & Fur**, **Moon Boots**, **Qrion** and many more. The label has also released remixes from some of the most exciting names in electronic and underground music today, including **CamelPhat**, **DJ Koze**, **Tale Of Us**, **Maya Jane Coles**, **Boris Brejcha**, **TSHA**, **Kenny Dope**, **NERO** and **Gerd Janson**.

### Channel: Founder Voice - Interview (Go-to-Market Strategy)

**Context:** Advice on GTM and founder-led content
**Source:** https://www.saasstrats.com/p/the-only-tool-you-need-to-actually-grow-on-x
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "Focus on your personal brand, then your product will sell itself. Figure out what makes you unique (usually it's just being your authentic self) and start posting online about it. Pick one channel you're familiar with, maybe that's X, maybe that's Reddit, maybe that's LinkedIn. And start posting. Network with others. And make 10% of your content about selling. People don't like being sold to, but do like supporting someone they believe in. As for when it comes to an actual go-to-market / launch day, share your story. And throughout the launch day post updates about what is/isn't working. At the end, summarise your wins and losses. That way you continually benefit from the snowball effect that is your launch."

### Channel: Founder Voice - Interview (Overcoming Challenges)

**Context:** Personal reflection on building a SaaS
**Source:** https://www.saasstrats.com/p/the-only-tool-you-need-to-actually-grow-on-x
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "Building a SaaS is an emotional rollercoaster. I found myself one day feeling like I was on the top of the world, and the next at the bottom of the deepest possible abyss. Then back to the top of the world the day after. This isn't sustainable and if prolonged will lead to burnout. I found the best way to overcome this is to completely detach myself from the outcomes and results of my pursuits. When I post something online, I don't check the results until a few hours or day later. Once you remove your emotions from your results, you can focus on what needs to be done without distraction, and the results will follow."

### Channel: Blog - Virality Thesis

**Context:** Long-form thought leadership on virality and growth
**Source:** https://cluely.com/blog/virality
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "## The Guarantee of X Virality
>
> In the world of tech twitter, a post that deserves to go viral will go viral, without exception, IF seen by at least a few thousand people.
>
> This is perhaps the single most important truth I have learned during my entire time on this platform.
>
> People here are very curious and eager to discover and share new things.
>
> Once you can cross a few thousand views, the reposts and engagement will take you to exactly where you deserve.
>
> On X, follower count largely doesn't matter past 10k. Someone with 200k followers might average 2k views. This algo is very content-dependent.
>
> **FACT: With enough of an organic base (~10k followers), viral content will go viral.**"

### Channel: Blog - Product Philosophy

**Context:** Blog post explaining product direction and timing
**Source:** https://cluely.com/blog/virality
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "Where does Cluely stand?
>
> Cluely has more than enough consistent usage that we can reliably test every single one of our new features against a pool of users and know where the product is retentive and where it is not.
>
> Cluely is post-PMF in a few areas. Interviews, certain quizzes and homework that require an undetectable AI. Enterprise clients who we've spent time building out custom workflows for.
>
> But conquering any of these will not end in the grander vision we have our eyes set on: the ultimate computer interface for multi-modal AI.
>
> We need faster magic moments in larger, tangential, consumer markets.
>
> To that end, we've spent the last few months working on making sure the product works for our more general users. There is a magic moment that exists with Cluely, but it does not exist for all the markets that interest us, yet.
>
> The truth is, it is actually quite hard to build software that feels truly magical to everyone. It takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of engineering talent.
>
> But we are very close."

### Channel: Blog - Meeting Bots Article

**Context:** Thought leadership on meeting bot UX
**Source:** https://cluely.com/blog/meeting-bots-surveillance
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "## The Meeting Bot
>
> Join any corporate call today and there's a good chance a gray, faceless circle named 'Notetaker AI' will join right after you.
>
> You pretend not to notice it, but it changes the way you behave.
>
> People talk less freely. People make fewer jokes.
>
> They turn every conversation into a monitored event. This kills sales calls, makes recruiting impossible, and makes you less money."

### Channel: Blog - Meeting Bots Article (Continued)

**Context:** Problem articulation and differentiation
**Source:** https://cluely.com/blog/meeting-bots-surveillance
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "## The Problem with Bots that Join
>
> The first generation of AI meeting tools tried to be helpful, but they got the interaction model wrong.
>
> AI meeting notes are really helpful. One of the most useful applications of AI, actually.
>
> But when you see a notetaker sitting in the participant list, it goes a step in the wrong direction and sends the wrong signal:
>
> **You're being recorded.**
>
> It's like having a third person standing in the corner of your living room, silently watching your conversation. Even if the intent is pure and no different than if I were taking notes on a notepad, the presence itself creates pressure.
>
> This is why sales reps turn off bots, why candidates tense up in interviews, and why deals get killed before leads are even qualified. Humans don't collaborate well when they feel they are being watched."

### Channel: Blog - Product Vision

**Context:** How Cluely positions its solution
**Source:** https://cluely.com/blog/meeting-bots-surveillance
**Date Accessed:** 2025-10-28

**Sample:**
> "## The Next Generation of Help
>
> AI notetakers shouldn't sit in the meeting with you.
>
> They should work the same way pen and paper did: personally and unobtrusively.
>
> It shouldn't take an extra meeting participant to do what pen and paper did in the past.
>
> The best AI notetakers shouldn't offer surveillance; they should offer notetaking."
