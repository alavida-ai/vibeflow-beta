## 1. Conversion Principles

### Single, Focused Conversion Goal
**Consensus:** All 3 sources

A high-converting landing page focuses on **one primary action** and eliminates competing goals.

- [Unbounce Examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/): "Present a single and focused call to action—your CTA is the one thing you want visitors to do on your page"
- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/product-landing-page/): "The core purpose of a product landing page is simple: drive conversions...every element on the page should work toward that goal"
- [Unbounce Best Practices](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/): "A great landing page focuses on a single conversion goal, so minimize other distractions"

### Message Match / Conversion Scent
**Consensus:** 2 of 3 sources

Maintaining consistency from ad → landing page → post-conversion dramatically improves performance.

- [Unbounce Examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/): Later's 57.92% conversion rate attributed to "conversion scent throughout the campaign—the offer matches what's in the ad, in the email, in the creative"
- [Unbounce Best Practices](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/): "Ensure your messaging matches your ads...signal that visitors have made a 'good click' by matching your landing page headline and copy to the ads"

**Evidence:** Later maintained conversion scent across their entire campaign and achieved 57.92% conversion rate.

### Benefits Over Features
**Consensus:** All 3 sources

Emphasizing how a product improves lives converts better than listing what it does.

- [Unbounce Examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/): "People are much more likely to convert if they understand the benefits they'll receive. Benefits-oriented messaging is one of the best ways to drive conversions"
- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/product-landing-page/): "Instead of listing features, emphasize the product benefits. Rather than 'Our tool has advanced analytics,' say 'Track your sales in real-time and make data-driven decisions effortlessly'"
- [Unbounce Best Practices](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/): TyresOnTheDrive found "more benefit-oriented messaging seems to convert better than pushing offers and promotions"

### Clear, Compelling CTAs
**Consensus:** All 3 sources

Calls to action should be **obvious, compelling, and descriptive** of what happens next.

- [Unbounce Examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/): "No landing page can make an impact without direct text and an eye-popping CTA button on the first fold"
- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/product-landing-page/): "A CTA should be clear, persuasive, and prominently placed. Instead of 'Submit,' opt for 'Start Your Free Trial' or 'Get Instant Access'"
- [Unbounce Best Practices](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/): ooba's 35.57% conversion achieved through "descriptive button that confirms the action they're about to take"

### Remove Navigation & Distractions
**Consensus:** All 3 sources

Eliminate links and navigation that might cause visitors to leave before converting.

### Simplicity Over Length
**Consensus:** 2 of 3 sources

Shorter, focused copy often converts better than comprehensive explanations (though context matters).

**Nuance:** [Unbounce Examples](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/high-converting-landing-pages/) notes that ClaimCompass (30.02% conversion) designed page "to make people click on one of the three CTA buttons. If the offer is appealing, they don't need to scroll further. If it isn't, the sections below provide more clarity"—suggesting progressive disclosure approach.
