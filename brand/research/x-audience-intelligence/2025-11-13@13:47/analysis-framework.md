# Competitive Research Analysis Framework

## How to Use This Template

Once x-scraper data is collected, analyze using these frameworks:

---

## 1. THREE-TIER ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS

Analyze how different engagement types reveal different audience insights:

### Tier 1: Saves (Signal = "I want to reference this later")
**What it means:** High-value, reusable information (frameworks, tactics, insights)
**Analysis questions:**
- What specific content types get saved?
- What problem-solving value does it offer?
- How does it help the audience in their daily work?

### Tier 2: Likes & Retweets (Signal = "I agree / this resonates")
**What it means:** Emotional resonance, validation, relatability
**Analysis questions:**
- What pain points does it articulate?
- What frustrations does it validate?
- What worldview does it reinforce?

### Tier 3: Replies (Signal = "I want to engage and respond")
**What it means:** Debate, questions, extensions, disagreement
**Analysis questions:**
- What conversations does it spark?
- Do replies extend the idea (adds to it) or question it (challenges it)?
- What follow-up questions emerge?

## 2. CONTENT SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS

Categorize all tweets into content types:

```
1. CONTRARIAN TAKES
   - Definition: Challenge industry narratives, state uncomfortable truths
   - Example: "Everyone's obsessed with AI replacing marketers. Here's why that's backwards..."
   - Engagement analysis: Do these get more debate? Saves? Strong POV alignment?

2. EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORKS
   - Definition: Teach systems, methods, or thinking models
   - Example: Threading through a marketing methodology or concept
   - Engagement analysis: Do these get saves? Shares? Applied by audience?

3. PAIN POINT VALIDATION
   - Definition: Name and validate specific frustrations audience experiences
   - Example: "Subscription fatigue is real. You forget about tools you paid for..."
   - Engagement analysis: Do these get high engagement? Strong agreement?

4. INDUSTRY CRITIQUE
   - Definition: Criticize competitors, vendors, or industry approaches
   - Example: "SaaS vendors charge more when you scale, never less..."
   - Engagement analysis: High engagement? Do people tag examples? Share?

5. CASE STUDY / PROOF
   - Definition: Share results, data, or specific examples
   - Example: "Moved X number of clients to owned infrastructure. Here's what happened..."
   - Engagement analysis: Saves? Questions? Requests for more detail?

6. PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENTS
   - Definition: State core beliefs and values
   - Example: "Marketing is strategic. The internet needs experts in the loop..."
   - Engagement analysis: Do they drive community? Attract like-minded people?

7. PRACTICAL TACTICS
   - Definition: Actionable tips and how-tos
   - Example: "Three ways to reduce subscription debt this quarter..."
   - Engagement analysis: Do tactical posts get engagement or are frameworks preferred?

8. QUESTIONS & SOLICITING FEEDBACK
   - Definition: Ask audience what they think, face, challenge
   - Example: "What's the #1 pain point you face with AI tools right now?"
   - Engagement analysis: Reply rate? Quality of responses?
```

**Analysis task:** Segment all 150 tweets into these categories. Chart which categories drive most engagement by type (saves, likes, replies).

---

## 3. PAIN POINT INVENTORY

Extract every pain point explicitly mentioned or implied:

```
When analyzing tweets, look for:

EXPLICIT MENTIONS:
- "I hate..."
- "The problem with..."
- "Why is nobody talking about..."
- "This frustrates me because..."

IMPLIED PAIN POINTS:
- What audience is asking for in replies
- What problems the author is proposing solutions to
- What industry narrative the author is pushing back against

Create inventory:
PAIN POINT | ENGAGEMENT (Likes/Saves/Replies) | CONTEXT | FREQUENCY
---------|------|---------|----------
Subscription fatigue | 2.5K likes, 800 saves | Thread on vendor extraction | Appears 3x in sample
Tool fragmentation | 1.8K likes | Automation/orchestration | Appears 2x
AI slop / generic content | 4.2K likes, 1.2K saves | Quality positioning | Appears 5x
Skill stagnation | 1.3K likes | Infrastructure building | Appears 2x
Vendor lock-in | 3.1K likes, 900 saves | Ownership philosophy | Appears 4x
```

## 4. VOICE & TONE ANALYSIS

Capture the linguistic patterns that resonate:

```
TONE CHARACTERISTICS:

Formality Level: __ / 100
  80-90: Professional but conversational
  70-79: Relaxed, accessible
  60-69: Casual, informal

Emotional Temperature: __ / 100
  80-90: Provocative, challenging, opinion-forward
  70-79: Confident, direct, assertive
  60-69: Balanced, neutral, educational

Humor/Personality: __ / 100
  70-80: Regular humor, personality-forward
  50-69: Some personality, mostly serious
  30-49: Minimal personality, information-focused

Evidence Orientation: __ / 100
  80-90: Heavily cited, frameworks, data
  70-79: Some evidence, mostly assertion
  60-69: Mostly assertion, some support

Directness: __ / 100
  80-90: Very direct, no hedging
  70-79: Fairly direct, some softening
  60-69: Balanced, careful language

LINGUISTIC PATTERNS:
- Recurring phrases/language
- Metaphors or analogies used
- How does author frame themselves?
- What vocabulary is repeated?

CONTRASTS TO NOTE:
- How different is this from mainstream marketing content?
- What stance does the author take that competitors don't?
- Where is the contrarian territory?
```

## 5. VALUE GAP IDENTIFICATION

Look for what's NOT being said or underserved:

```
HIGH ENGAGEMENT + LOW FREQUENCY = VALUE GAP

Example:
Topic: "Ownership/Infrastructure Independence"
Engagement: 3.1K likes, 900 saves (high)
Frequency in sample: Appears only 2x (low)
Gap hypothesis: Audience craves ownership narrative but few voices champion it

Create matrix:
TOPIC | ENGAGEMENT STRENGTH | FREQUENCY | GAP SIZE | OPPORTUNITY
------|------------|-----------|----------|----------
Ownership vs Rental | Very high | Low | HUGE | Unclaimed narrative territory
Human-in-loop/anti-automation | High | Moderate | Medium | Underserved positioning
Systems thinking/architecture | High | Low | LARGE | Massive opportunity
Anti-AI-slop/quality focus | Very high | Low | HUGE | Moral + differentiation angle
Infrastructure building | Moderate-High | Low | LARGE | Technical + philosophy combo
Contrarian positioning | High | Moderate | Medium | Clear appetite for takes
```

## 6. VIBEFLOW DIFFERENTIATION ANALYSIS

Given agonda's positioning, assess where unique territory exists:

```
VIBEFLOW POSITIONING | @BORINGMARKETER COVERAGE | OPPORTUNITY
---|---|---
"Own your infrastructure" | Mentioned but not primary | CLAIM THIS
"Avoid AI slop" | High engagement but few solutions | SOLUTION POSITIONING
"Human in loop" | Rarely explicit | STRONG DIFFERENTIATION
"Complexity as moat" | Not present | UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
"Marketing Architect identity" | Not established | BUILD THIS MOVEMENT
"Empowerment over ease" | Some presence | DEEPEN & OWN
"Systems thinking" | Present but not owned | BECOME THE SYSTEMS EXPERT
"Augmentation not replacement" | Implied but not explicit | MAKE IT EXPLICIT
```

---

## 7. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS SYNTHESIS

After completing all analyses, synthesize into findings:

```

1. HIGHEST-ENGAGEMENT CONTENT TYPES
   [List content types that consistently drive saves/engagement]
   Implication for agonda: [What should we create?]

2. DOMINANT PAIN POINTS

   Implication for agonda: [Which resonate with our positioning?]

3. VALUE GAPS / UNDERSERVED NARRATIVES

4. VOICE/TONE OBSERVATIONS
