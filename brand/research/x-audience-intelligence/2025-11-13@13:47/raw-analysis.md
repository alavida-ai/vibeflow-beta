## Engagement Analysis: Likes vs. Saves vs. Views

### High-Performing Content Pattern

**Top Performer #1: "How to turn website into revenue machine"**

- Ratio: Save:Like = 2.1:1, indicating audience wants to save and apply

**Top Performer #2: "15 Claude Code habits"**

## Pain Points & Frustrations Detected

### Explicit Pain Points Mentioned

1. **Tool Sprawl / Fragmentation**
   - "I used to use 10-15 AI tools, now literally 90%+ of the work I do is handled by TWO"
   - **Implication:** Audience frustrated by too many tools, seeking consolidation

2. **Cost Optimization Obsession**
   - 15 habits entirely focused on: "go from $400/week to $15/week"
   - Specific savings: "$0.80 per session," "$0.05 vs $5," "100x cheaper"
   - **Implication:** Cost is major pain point; audience tracks spending obsessively

3. **Inefficiency Despite AI Adoption**
   - "Too many marketers are still using AI in isolation, without a strategic goal, without systems in place"
   - **Implication:** AI overwhelm; people using tools without systematic approach

4. **Complexity of Implementation**
   - Detailed tutorials needed ("~30 minutes," "~5 hours," step-by-step guides)
   - **Implication:** Implementation knowledge gap; audience needs guidance

5. **Agency Critique / DIY Desire**
   - "do it all yourself without spending thousands $ and months working w/ a slow agency"
   - **Implication:** Distrust of traditional agencies; want DIY control

## Audience Identity / Aspirations

### Self-Identification

**"Vibe Marketers"** - @boringmarketer has created an identity/community label
- 2,600+ members identified as "vibe marketers"
- Implies: Systems-thinking operators, AI-native, builder mindset
- **Resonance:** Identity-based community building works

### What This Audience Wants

1. **Systems-based approach** (not point solutions)
2. **Cost efficiency** (optimization obsession)
3. **DIY capability** (control, no agency dependence)
4. **Tactical implementation** (not philosophy, not theory)
5. **Community of peers** (shared identity: "vibe marketers")
6. **Consolidation** (fewer, better tools)

---

## Voice & Tone Observations

### Linguistic Patterns

**Directness:** Extremely direct, no hedging
- "Tell me how AEO/GEO differs" (not "explore differences")
- "You won't need UIs like this" (definitive claim)
- "The more you progress, the fewer tools you need" (strong statement)

**Casualness:** ~75-80% casual
- "let's vibe!!" (informal)
- "Too many marketers are still using AI in isolation" (conversational)
- Professional but approachable

**Specificity:** Obsessive about numbers
- "$400 per week to $15"
- "2,847 members" not "thousands"
- "$1,000+ value" not "great value"
- Line numbers ("line 45") not approximations

**Evidence-based:** Concrete examples always
- Screenshots of prompts/results
- Video tutorials showing actual work
- Specific tool names (Claude Code, Cursor, Perplexity, Firecrawl, n8n)
- Real metrics from real work

**Anti-hype:** Actively rejects marketing speak
- "Boring beats shiny"
- "Specific beats vague"
- "Focus in on what drives results, ignore the rest"

---

## Content Format Success

### What Works

1. **Numbered Lists with Specifics** (15 habits, 10 takeaways, etc.)
   - Formula: [Number] [Topic]: [Specific claim] + [Evidence/Metric]
   - Drives saves, shares, implementation

2. **Before/After Metrics**
   - "$400/week to $15/week"
   - "10-15 tools to 2 tools"
   - "~5 hours doing boring work" → "10 takeaways"

3. **Tutorial/How-To Threads**
   - Video demonstrations embedded
   - Step-by-step breakdown
   - Implementable immediately

4. **Contrarian Problem Statements**
   - "AEO/GEO differs from SEO how?"
   - "You won't need UIs like this"
   - "Agents vs. Workflows" comparison

5. **Community/Identity Posts**
   - "Vibe marketers" language
   - Shared problem, shared solution
   - Creates belonging

### What Underperforms

- Pure philosophical takes (no tactical action)
- Generic inspiration ("slow down to speed up")
- No specific numbers or evidence
- No implementable next steps
