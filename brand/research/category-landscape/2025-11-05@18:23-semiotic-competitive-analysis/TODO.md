## Key Finding

**Competition Level: MINIMAL TO NONE**

Semiotic validates our market thesis (AI+quality demand exists) without threatening our strategic position due to:
- Different business models (service vs. infrastructure)
- Different customer outcomes (deliverable vs. capability)
- Different categories (agency vs. architecture)
- Structural moat (they cannot adopt ownership model without breaking revenue)
