- [x] Perplexity search for company background
- [x] Analyze core offering and business model
- [x] Create artifact: `artifacts/01-website-product-analysis.md` ✅

**Key Finding:** Service agency for VC-backed founders. NOT infrastructure/platform.

### Phase 2: Founder & Team Research ✅
- [x] Research founders' names and backgrounds
- [x] Research funding/announcements
- [x] Analyze expertise and credibility
- [x] Create artifact: `artifacts/02-founder-team-research.md` ✅

**Key Finding:** Emmett Shine = designer/creative director. NOT architect/infrastructure builder.

### Phase 3A: Company Social Media Analysis ✅
- [x] Identify company Twitter/X handle (@littleplainsxo)
- [x] Scrape company tweets (last 6 months, top engagement)
- [x] Analyze messaging themes and engagement
- [x] Create artifact: `artifacts/03a-company-social-analysis.md` ✅

### Phase 3B: Founder Social Media Analysis ✅

- [x] Scrape founder tweets (last 6 months, top engagement)
- [x] Analyze thought leadership positioning

### Phase 4: Competitive Positioning Assessment ✅

- [x] Assess business model overlap
- [x] Evaluate target audience overlap
- [x] Determine competitive threat level
- [x] Create artifact: `artifacts/04-competitive-assessment.md` ✅

**Key Finding:** LOW competitive threat. Different cluster (AI-Native Services). Zero overlap on Alavida's white space (ownership, infrastructure, architect identity).

**Resumption Note (2025-11-06 01:15):** Resuming workflow from Phase 4. Phases 1-3 artifacts preserved. Phase 4 and 5 will be regenerated with fresh analysis.

### Phase 5: Research Summary & Index Update ✅
- [x] Synthesize findings into RESEARCH.md
- [x] Update category-landscape index RESEARCH.md
- [x] Document strategic implications
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with Little Plains entry

**Key Finding:** Index updated with Little Plains as Cluster 4 (AI-Native Services). White space remains protected - zero overlap on infrastructure ownership, architecture, or builder positioning.
