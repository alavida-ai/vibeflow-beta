## 2025-11-05 - Added Semiotic (Competitor #19)

**Source:** [2025-11-05@18:23-semiotic-competitive-analysis](/brand/research/category-landscape/2025-11-05@18:23-semiotic-competitive-analysis/)

**Changes:**
- Added Semiotic competitor profile (AI-native design firm, service model)
- Updated comparison table and white space analysis
- Created new cluster: "AI-Native Services" (11%)

**Key insight:** Semiotic validates anti-slop positioning + quality/speed messaging works, but operates in different category (service vs. infrastructure). See [detailed analysis](/brand/research/category-landscape/2025-11-05@18:23-semiotic-competitive-analysis/RESEARCH.md).
