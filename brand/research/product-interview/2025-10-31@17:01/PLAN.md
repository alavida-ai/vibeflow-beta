## Research Objective

Conduct a structured interview to deeply understand Agonda's product architecture, business model, and operational mechanics. This research will inform the creation of a product strategy document that complements existing brand strategy.

**Gap Being Filled:**
While we have comprehensive brand strategy (positioning, messaging, voice, audience), we lack detailed product-level documentation covering technical architecture, business model, customer journey, and product differentiation mechanics.
