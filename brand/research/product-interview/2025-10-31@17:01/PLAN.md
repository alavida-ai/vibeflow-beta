**Research Type:** Discovery Interview
**Domain:** product-interview
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Interviewer:** Claude (Marketing Operations Manager)

## Research Objective

Conduct a structured interview to deeply understand Vibeflow's product architecture, business model, and operational mechanics. This research will inform the creation of a product strategy document that complements existing brand strategy.

**Gap Being Filled:**
While we have comprehensive brand strategy (positioning, messaging, voice, audience), we lack detailed product-level documentation covering technical architecture, business model, customer journey, and product differentiation mechanics.
