## Core Product Model Discovery

### The Framework vs. Platform Insight

**Direct Quote:**
> "We are creating the Agentic Marketing Architecture which is the new age agent architecture that uses the file system and cli based agents in this case claude code to manage and run your marketing activities with an agentic first approach."

**Business Model Analogy:**
> "We deem the product analogous to how Vercel monetised Next.js—you don't monetise the framework you monetise the ecosystem around it."

**Key Distinction:** Vibeflow/Alavida is NOT a traditional SaaS product. It's a **framework/methodology** (like Next.js) with an **ecosystem monetization model** (like Vercel).

## The Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: The Framework (Open/Free)
**Name:** Agentic Marketing Architecture (AMA)
**Documentation:** https://marketingarchitect.ai/

**Technical Implementation:**
> "It's a Claude Code repo. Each brand has its own repo."

**What It Is:**
- File system-based marketing architecture
- Claude Code repository structure
- Each brand/company creates their own repo following AMA patterns
- Methodology for "marketing as code"
- **Analogous to:** Next.js framework (open, free, community-driven)

**Distribution Model:** Open framework, not proprietary

**The Four Core Principles:**
1. **AI Should Augment, Not Replace** - Stand against AI slop
2. **Empowerment Over Ease** - Competency creates competitive advantage
3. **Own Your Stack, Don't Rent It** - Infrastructure independence equals business independence
4. **Context is Sacred** - First architecture that addresses context engineering in marketing

**The 5-Layer Org Chart Model:**
```
Layer 1: Marketing Architect (Human) - System designer
    ↓
Layer 2: Operations Manager (Primary AI Agent) - Orchestrates work
    ↓
Layer 3: Team Layer (Sub-agents) - Specialized execution
    ↓
Layer 4: Skill Layer (Capabilities) - Reusable workflows
    ↓
Layer 5: Integration Layer (Tools) - External services/APIs
```

**File Structure Pattern:**
```
/workspace-root/
├── .claude/                          ← Architecture configuration
│   ├── output-styles/                ← Primary agent behavior
│   ├── agents/                       ← Sub-agent definitions
│   ├── skills/                       ← Reusable capabilities
│   └── commands/                     ← Workflow triggers
│
├── /brand/                           ← Brand folder (like src/)
│   ├── /strategy/                    ← Brand bible (polished)
│   ├── /research/                    ← Research domains (temporal)
│   └── /content/                     ← Output deliverables
│
├── .mcp.json                         ← Tool integrations
└── CLAUDE.md                         ← Project instructions
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Lives in Claude Code (IDE-based)
- Version controlled with Git
- File-based information architecture
- Progressive disclosure (load context only when needed)
- One-way dependencies (context flows downward)
- Temporal execution (research/strategy evolves over time)

---

### Layer 2: Ecosystem Tools (Monetized - Usage-Based)

#### Current Product: X-Scraper MCP
**Live At:** https://x-scraper.alavida.ai/mcp

**Technical Architecture:**
> "It's an MCP it integrates with any AI tool."

**Capabilities:**
- Scrape X/Twitter posts
- Use cases: Competitor research, identifying high-engagement content frameworks
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration → works with Claude, GPT, any AI tool
- **Data hosting:** Alavida hosts the scraped data
- **Dashboard:** Firecrawl-style visualization for scrapes
- **Primary interface:** In-memory tool (data accessible in AI context)

**Value Proposition:**
> "Primary value is the scraped content."

**Pricing Model:**
> "All of our tools will be usage-based, so there's no subscriptions."

**Positioning:**
> "We won't lock you in, and the focus is on developing the framework."

**Why MCP Strategy:**
- Not locked to Claude Code specifically
- Works with any AI tool that supports MCP
- Platform-agnostic tool ecosystem
- Future-proof as new AI platforms emerge

---

### Layer 3: Platform Services (Alavida)
**Status:** "Still figuring this out"

**Platform Purpose:**
> "Alavida will be the primary platform to launch all of this."

**Current Understanding:**
- Account system for accessing ecosystem tools
- Dashboard for tool management (like x-scraper dashboard)
- Marketplace/launcher for AMA tools
- Usage tracking and billing
- **Future:** Deployment infrastructure, observability/monitoring

**Domain Strategy:**
- Main platform: alavida.ai
- Tool-specific subdomains: x-scraper.alavida.ai (pattern for future tools)

---

## Product Philosophy Consolidation

### "Marketing as Code"
**Core Principle:**
> "It differs from SaaS products because it's marketing as code, it's selling marketers on upskilling and utilising an advanced framework in performing their marketing operations."

**Not Selling:** Features, convenience, "easy buttons"
**Selling:** Framework adoption, upskilling, capability building

**What "Marketing as Code" Means:**
- Marketing operations run from IDE (Claude Code)
- Version-controlled brand systems (Git)
- File-based architecture (structured hierarchy)
- Systematic workflows (reusable, improvable)
- Infrastructure you own (not rent)

### No Lock-In Commitment
**Explicit Positioning:**
> "We won't lock you in, and the focus is on developing the framework."

**How This Works:**
- Usage-based pricing (not subscription)
- MCP tools integrate with any AI platform (not just Claude)
- Framework is open (repos belong to users)
- Tools are utilities, not dependencies

### Community Strategy
**Target:**
> "We want to build a community of cracked marketers around this."

**Identity:** "Cracked marketers" (elite, high-performing practitioners who adopt advanced frameworks)

**Community Philosophy:**
- Not mass-market "all marketers"
- Self-selecting through complexity
- Framework-first thinking
- "Marketing Architect" identity

## Technical Architecture Deep-Dive

### The Claude Code Repo Structure
- Each brand creates their own Claude Code repository
- Repository follows AMA file structure patterns (documented at marketingarchitect.ai)
- Users own their repo completely
- Framework provides structure, patterns, methodology
- Version controlled with Git (full history, collaboration)

### MCP Integration Strategy
- Tools built as MCP servers (Model Context Protocol)
- Works with any AI tool that supports MCP (Claude, GPT, future models)
- Not locked to Claude Code specifically (though that's the recommended interface)
- Data stored by Alavida but accessible via MCP
- Tools provide capabilities, framework defines how they're used

### Alavida Platform Layer
- Hosts tool infrastructure (X-scraper backend, data storage)
- Provides dashboards for visualization
- Handles billing/usage tracking
- Launches new tools under *.alavida.ai subdomains
- Usage-based billing (not subscription)

### Framework Documentation Site

## Vercel Analogy Deep-Dive

| **Next.js (Framework)** | **AMA (Framework)** |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Open-source React framework | Open marketing framework |
| GitHub repo you clone | Claude Code repo you create |
| File-based routing | File-based marketing architecture |
| Community-driven | "Cracked marketers" community |
| **Free to use** | **Free to use** |
| Documentation site (nextjs.org) | Documentation site (marketingarchitect.ai) |

| **Vercel (Platform)** | **Alavida (Platform)** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Deployment infrastructure | Marketing tool infrastructure |
| Analytics & monitoring | Dashboard & observability |
| Account-based access | Account-based access |
| Usage-based pricing | Usage-based pricing |
| Edge functions, CDN | X-scraper MCP, future tools |
| *.vercel.app subdomains | *.alavida.ai subdomains |

**Key Parallel:** You can use Next.js without Vercel (deploy anywhere), but Vercel makes it easier/better. Similarly, you can use AMA without Alavida tools, but Alavida MCP tools enhance the framework.

**Strategic Insight:** This model allows:
- Framework adoption without vendor lock-in
- Community growth around open framework
- Monetization through value-add tools
- Platform independence (users truly own their system)

---

## Framework vs. Traditional Marketing Tools

| **Traditional SaaS** | **AMA Framework** |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Rent access to platform | Own your repository |
| Subscription dependency | Usage-based tools (optional) |
| Vendor controls data | You control all data (Git repo) |
| Platform-specific skills | Transferable framework skills |
| Black-box automation | Transparent, inspectable workflows |
| "Easy button" convenience | Empowerment through competency |
| Tool user identity | Marketing Architect identity |
| Click interface | IDE + file system |
| Limited customization | Fully customizable (code-level) |
