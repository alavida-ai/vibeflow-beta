**Tasks:**
1. Prioritize weaknesses by conversion impact
2. Map brand misalignments to specific page elements
3. Develop improvement recommendations (quick wins vs strategic)
4. Suggest A/B testing opportunities
5. Create implementation roadmap

**Output Artifact:** `05-recommendations.md`
- Prioritized weakness list
- Quick win opportunities
- Strategic improvement plan
