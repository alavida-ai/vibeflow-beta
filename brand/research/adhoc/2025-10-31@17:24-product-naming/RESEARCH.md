## 2. Brand Strategy Foundation

All name recommendations are grounded in these brand truths from [strategy synthesis](/brand/research/adhoc/2025-10-31@17:24-product-naming/artifacts/01-brand-synthesis.md):

### Category Positioning: "Marketing Architecture"
- **FACT:** 0% of 18 competitors use "architect," "architecture," or "infrastructure" terminology
- Strategic white space completely unclaimed
- Name must reinforce this category ownership

### Three Core Differentiators (Must Reflect in Name)
1. **Capability Over Convenience** - 85% of competitors promise "ease," we position on mastery
2. **Ownership Over Subscription** - 100% of competitors use SaaS models, we enable infrastructure ownership
3. **Augmentation Over Replacement** - Competitors imply AI replaces humans, we position AI as leverage

### Five Brand Pillars (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Capability Over Convenience** → Avoid "easy/simple" signals
2. **Own Your Stack** → Convey permanence, not rental/service
3. **Architect Systems** → Signal building/design, not tools/utilities
4. **Enhance Humans** → Suggest collaboration, not automation
5. **Quality Through Craft** → Signal precision, not speed/volume

### Naming Disqualifiers (Strategic Constraints)
- ❌ Never signal ease/simplicity (contradicts positioning)
- ❌ Never suggest automation/replacement (violates human-loop philosophy)
- ❌ Never feel mass-market (serve ambitious 5-10%)
- ❌ Never imply speed/volume over quality

### Cultural Context
- Must honor Spanish-American roots (founders: "Alavida" = "To life")
- Must work across English/Spanish markets
- Should feel cohesive with Alavida brand identity

---

## 3. Top 3 Name Recommendations (Detailed Analysis)

### RECOMMENDATION #1: TECTARA ✅

**Pronunciation:** tek-TAR-ah
**Brand Score:** 8.8/10 | **Feasibility Score:** 10/10

#### Etymology & Strategic Rationale

From Greek **"tekton"** (τέκτων) meaning builder, architect, craftsman—the same root that gives us "tectonic" and "architect"—fused with Romance language elegance through the **"-ara"** suffix (evoking Carrara marble).

#### Why This Name Wins

**Brand Alignment:**
- Perfect architectural etymology reinforces "Marketing Architect" identity
- Carrara marble evocation = refined craftsmanship (Pillar 5: Quality Through Craft)
- Greek precision + Romance elegance = sophisticated international appeal
- Zero competitors use Greek architectural roots in AI marketing

**Feasibility Excellence:**
- **Domain:** tectara.com/.ai/.io all highly likely available
- **Trademark:** Maximum protection—invented word, zero conflicts
- **Legal Risk:** Very low—no USPTO conflicts in Class 35/42
- **Cost:** Standard registration ($125-165/year)

**Strategic Narrative:**
*"From Greek 'tekton'—builder, architect, craftsman—comes Tectara. Just as the finest structures are built with Carrara marble, the finest marketing systems are architected with Tectara."*

**When to Choose Tectara:**
- ✅ Legal certainty is top priority
- ✅ Speed to market matters (4-6 weeks)
- ✅ Maximum trademark protection needed
- ✅ Premium international positioning
- ✅ Standard budget ($10-30K Year 1)

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- ⚠️ Pronunciation education required → Mitigate with pronunciation guide in all materials
- ⚠️ No Spanish cultural connection → Mitigate with Spanish market messaging emphasizing international sophistication

---

### RECOMMENDATION #2: CIMIENTO

**Pronunciation:** see-MYEN-toh
**Brand Score:** 9.1/10 (HIGHEST) | **Feasibility Score:** 9/10

#### Etymology & Strategic Rationale

Spanish word meaning **"foundation"** or **"groundwork"**—the base upon which all structures are built.

#### Why This Name Is Strong

**Brand Alignment (HIGHEST SCORE):**
- Perfect ownership positioning: foundations are permanent, owned, not rented (Pillar 2)
- Direct architectural metaphor reinforces Marketing Architecture category
- Easiest Spanish pronunciation for English speakers (see-MYEN-toh)
- Strong Alavida cultural cohesion (Spanish authenticity)

**Feasibility:**
- **Domain:** Likely available (uncommon Spanish word in English tech sector)
- **Trademark:** No USPTO conflicts detected in Class 35/42
- **Legal Risk:** Low-medium—requires professional clearance
- **Cost:** Standard registration if available

**Strategic Narrative:**
*"Cimiento—foundation. In Spanish, it's what endures. What you own. What you build upon. Not what you rent. Not what disappears when the subscription ends. Your marketing foundation. Your cimiento."*

**When to Choose Cimiento:**
- ✅ Highest brand alignment is priority
- ✅ Spanish cultural authenticity matters
- ✅ Domain verification confirms availability
- ✅ "Foundation/ownership" metaphor resonates strongly

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- ⚠️ Domain availability unknown → **ACTION REQUIRED:** Immediate domain check
- ⚠️ May feel literal once translated → Mitigate with metaphorical depth in messaging
- ⚠️ Requires availability confirmation → Decision contingent on domain status

---

### RECOMMENDATION #3: MERCADA

**Pronunciation:** mer-KAH-dah
**Brand Score:** 8.5/10 | **Feasibility Score:** 7.5/10

#### Etymology & Strategic Rationale

Invented Spanish feminine form from **"mercado"** (market)—transforming market from transactional space into owned infrastructure.

#### Why This Name Has Potential

**Brand Alignment:**
- **Strongest Alavida cohesion:** -ada ending creates sonic parallelism (Alavida, Mercada)
- Market-as-system metaphor: reframes marketing as infrastructure, not campaigns
- Invented feminine form = distinctive trademark potential
- 3-syllable rhythm matches Alavida perfectly

**Feasibility:**
- **Domain:** Likely available (invented form)
- **Trademark:** No conflicts detected (invented suffix creates distinctiveness)
- **Legal Risk:** Low-medium—invented term reduces generic risk
- **Cost:** Standard registration if available

**Strategic Narrative:**
*"Mercada—the market place reimagined. Not where you go to buy and sell. Where you build. Where you architect. Your owned infrastructure for marketing systems. In the Alavida family: to life (Alavida), to market (Mercada)."*

**When to Choose Mercada:**
- ✅ Alavida brand family cohesion is top priority
- ✅ Market-as-infrastructure metaphor resonates
- ✅ Domain verification confirms availability
- ✅ Spanish-American cultural theme essential

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- ⚠️ Domain availability unknown → **ACTION REQUIRED:** Immediate domain check
- ⚠️ Less direct architectural meaning → Mitigate with metaphor education
- ⚠️ Market = transactional associations → Reframe through infrastructure lens
