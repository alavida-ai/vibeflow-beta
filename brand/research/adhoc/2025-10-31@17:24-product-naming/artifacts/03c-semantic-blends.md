- **Recommendation:** Trademark attorney consultation essential; likely challenging

**SEO/searchability:**
- Moderate uniqueness (narrative is common term)
- Risk: Confusion with Narrato (existing competitor)
- May compete with general "narrative" content in search

**International considerations:**
- "Narrative" is international term (works globally)
- Pronunciation clear
- No negative connotations detected

---

### Strengths & Potential Concerns

**Strengths:**

1. **Marketing-native concept** - Narrative is core to brand strategy/content work
2. **Quality positioning** - Narrative = craft/storytelling (anti-AI-slop)
3. **Human-centric** - Storytelling requires human creativity/judgment
4. **Premium feel** - Literary/cultural sophistication
5. **Clear category signal** - Immediately suggests marketing/content work

**Potential concerns:**

1. **Narrato conflict** - Existing AI tool with very similar name (likely blocks trademark/causes confusion)
2. **Content tool feel** - Risks feeling like AI writing tool vs. architecture platform
3. **Crowded semantic space** - Many AI tools position on content/storytelling
4. **Weaker systems fit** - Less obviously "architecture/infrastructure" than Orchestrix/Synthetica
5. **Descriptive term** - "Narrative" is common (harder to own/defend)

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Position as "narrative architecture" (systems-level vs. content-level)
- Emphasize strategic narrative (brand strategy) vs. tactical content
- Differentiate from Narrato explicitly
- **Likely not viable due to Narrato conflict**

### Overall Assessment

**Score: 6.0/10** (would be 7.5/10 without Narrato conflict)

**Must-have requirements:**
- ✅ Does NOT signal ease/convenience/simplicity
- ✅ Does NOT suggest automation/replacement/autonomy
- ✅ Does NOT feel mass-market (though more accessible than other candidates)
- ❌ **MAJOR ISSUE:** Likely domain/trademark conflicts with Narrato
- ✅ Pronounceable

**Strategy-specific criteria (Marketing + AI Blends):**
- ✅ Fuses marketing (narrative) with technical suffix
- ⚠️ Moderate technical sophistication (narrative is accessible concept)
- ❌ **FAILS differentiation:** Narrato already exists, content tool space crowded
- ✅ Suggests human craft (narrative = storytelling skill)

**Recommendation:** **Weak candidate due to Narrato conflict and crowded semantic space**. While "narrative" is marketing-appropriate and quality-focused, the existing "Narrato" AI tool creates confusion/trademark risk. Additionally, content/storytelling territory is more crowded than systems/orchestration territory. **Not recommended** unless trademark attorney confirms clear differentiation path.

## Final Recommendation for Strategy 3

**Top pick: Synthetica** - Best balance of technical sophistication, premium positioning, and strategic differentiation. The name successfully signals systematic synthesis (core to both AI and marketing strategy) while avoiding all forbidden language patterns (ease, automation, convenience). Strong anti-AI-slop positioning through emphasis on synthesis as disciplined methodology.

**Runner-up: Orchestrix** - If product-market fit is prioritized over abstraction, Orchestrix is exceptional. The name literally describes what the product does (agentic orchestration of marketing systems) and occupies unclaimed semantic territory in AI marketing.

**Cultural alternative: Resonara** - If Spanish-American cultural alignment is critical decision factor, Resonara provides Romance language elegance while maintaining marketing relevance (resonance = core brand strategy outcome).
