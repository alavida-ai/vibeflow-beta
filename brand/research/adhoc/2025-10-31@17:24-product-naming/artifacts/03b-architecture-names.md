- Technical term with precise meaning in both physical and digital architecture

**Strategic Fit Against Brand Constraints:**
- ✅ Does NOT suggest automation (scaffolding supports human builders, doesn't replace them)
- ✅ Emphasizes capability (scaffolding enables skilled work at scale)
- ✅ Feels technical and substantial (construction/engineering term)
- ✅ Suggests temporary infrastructure for building permanent systems (enabling transformation)

**Preliminary Trademark/Domain Viability:**
- **Domain check needed:** scaffold.com (likely taken)
- **Domain alternatives:** scaffold.ai, getscaffold.com, scaffoldmarketing.com
- **Trademark concern:** Used in construction and dev tools—need to verify marketing/AI availability
- **Uniqueness:** Fresh in marketing/AI category but familiar to technical audiences

**Potential Concerns:**
- "Scaffold" can imply temporary/transitional (vs. permanent infrastructure)
- May suggest you eventually remove it (scaffolding comes down after building is complete)
- Less premium/sophisticated feel than atelier or tectonic (more utilitarian)
- Could be perceived as just another "builder" metaphor (though more specific)

**Overall Assessment:** Strong infrastructure metaphor with good technical credibility. However, temporary nature of physical scaffolding may undermine "permanent ownership" positioning. Better as supporting concept than primary brand name.
