# Product Naming Research Plan

**Created:** 2025-10-31
**Domain:** Ad-hoc Research
**Status:** Planning

---

## Objective

Generate strategic name candidates for the Agentic Marketing Architecture product (currently "vibeflow"—placeholder name that's taken and no longer suitable).

**Success Criteria:**
- 15-25 name candidates across 4-5 distinct naming strategies
- Each name evaluated against brand strategy alignment (positioning, voice, pillars)
- Each name evaluated for trademark/domain availability feasibility
- Names ranked by strategic fit, memorability, and differentiation
- Clear recommendation with rationale

---

## Context

### Company Background

**Alavida** ("To life" in Spanish) - Founded by Spanish and American co-founders
- Name chosen for dual cultural resonance: meaningful Spanish phrase + sounds like southern USA place names (Los Angeles, Florida, Sacramento, Las Vegas, El Dorado)
- Strong Spanish-American cultural roots and geographic associations

### Current Placeholder

**"Vibeflow"** - No longer viable (taken, doesn't fit strategic positioning)

### Naming Requirements

**Must:**
1. Align with Spanish-American cultural theme (either directly or abstractly)
2. Convey marketing and/or AI meaning (directly or abstractly)
3. Support "Marketing Architecture" category positioning
4. Reinforce brand pillars: ownership, capability, systems-building, quality
5. Be ownable (trademark/domain availability)

**Should:**
- Work well in both English and Spanish-speaking markets
- Support premium/sophisticated positioning (not mass market)
- Feel like infrastructure/architecture/systems (not consumer SaaS)
- Avoid sounding like every other "AI marketing tool"

---

## Approach

### Phase 1: Deep Brand Understanding
Load and synthesize all relevant brand strategy to ensure naming candidates authentically reflect positioning, pillars, and voice.

### Phase 2: Naming Strategy Exploration
Develop 4-5 distinct naming avenues based on:
- Spanish-inspired names (honoring Alavida roots)
- Architecture/infrastructure metaphors
- Marketing + AI semantic blends
- Place-based naming (following Alavida pattern)
- Abstract/evocative approaches

### Phase 3: Name Generation
Generate 15-25 candidates across strategies with rationale for each.

### Phase 4: Strategic Evaluation
Evaluate each candidate against:
- Brand strategy alignment (positioning, pillars, voice)
- Memorability and distinctiveness
- Linguistic qualities (pronunciation, international appeal)
- Domain/trademark feasibility (preliminary check)
- Competitive differentiation

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Recommendation
Rank candidates and provide clear recommendation with strategic rationale.

## Step by Step Tasks

### 1. Brand Strategy Synthesis
**Agent:** Analyst
**Input Data:**
- `/brand/strategy/brand-fundamentals/STRATEGY.md`
- `/brand/strategy/positioning/STRATEGY.md`
- `/brand/strategy/messaging/STRATEGY.md`
- `/brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md`

**Task:**
Synthesize the Agentic Marketing Architecture brand strategy into naming criteria and brand truth statements that will guide name evaluation.

**Deliverable:**
- Understanding of positioning (Marketing Architecture, ownership, capability over convenience)
- Brand pillars (5 pillars from brand-fundamentals)
- Voice attributes (technical credibility, intellectual provocation, anti-dependency)
- Strategic constraints (what we never say/do)
- Target audience (marketing strategists, agency owners, ambitious 5-10%)

**Output Artifact:** `artifacts/01-brand-synthesis.md`

### 2. Naming Strategy Development
**Agent:** Strategist
**Input Data:**
- `artifacts/01-brand-synthesis.md`
- Company context: Alavida roots (Spanish-American, place-name quality)
- Naming requirements from this plan

**Task:**
Develop 4-5 distinct naming strategies that honor:
1. **Spanish-inspired approach** - Names drawing from Spanish language/culture (like Alavida)
2. **Architecture/infrastructure metaphors** - Names that evoke systems, building, structure
3. **Marketing + AI semantic blends** - Names that fuse marketing and AI concepts
4. **Place-based naming** - Names that sound like places (following Alavida pattern)
5. **Abstract/evocative approach** - Names that feel premium/sophisticated without literal meaning

For each strategy, define:
- Strategic rationale (why this approach fits the brand)
- Naming principles (what makes a good name in this category)
- Example patterns to explore
- How it differentiates from "vibeflow" and competitor names

**Output Artifact:** `artifacts/02-naming-strategies.md`

### 3. Name Generation (Parallel Exploration)

#### 3a. Spanish-Inspired Names
**Agent:** Analyst (research) + General (generation)
**Input Data:**
- `artifacts/01-brand-synthesis.md`
- `artifacts/02-naming-strategies.md` (Spanish-inspired strategy section)

**Instructions:**
Generate 5-7 name candidates inspired by Spanish language/culture that:
- Honor Alavida's Spanish-American roots
- Convey meaning related to marketing, AI, systems, architecture, or ownership
- Sound sophisticated (not consumer-friendly)
- Work internationally (pronounceable in English and Spanish)

**Research component:**
- Explore Spanish words related to: architecture (arquitectura, estructura), building (construir, edificar), craft (oficio, artesanía), systems (sistemas), intelligence (inteligencia), strategy (estrategia)
- Consider Spanish place names and geographic features
- Look for words that sound like southern USA place names

**Output Artifact:** `artifacts/03a-spanish-names.md`

- Evoke systems, building, structure, foundations
- Feel premium and sophisticated
- Avoid generic tech naming (no "builder," "stack," "forge")

**Consider:**
- Architectural concepts: blueprint, foundation, scaffold, structure
- Infrastructure terms: framework, backbone, substrate

#### 3c. Marketing + AI Semantic Blends
**Agent:** General
**Input Data:**
- `artifacts/01-brand-synthesis.md`

- Create portmanteaus or compound words
- Sound sophisticated and technical (not consumer-friendly)
- Differentiate from competitor naming patterns

**Explore:**
- Marketing concepts: strategy, campaign, narrative, resonance
- AI concepts: neural, cognitive, synthetic, adaptive
- Systems concepts: orchestration, synthesis, architecture

**Output Artifact:** `artifacts/03c-semantic-blends.md`

- Could be real or invented places
- Must feel premium and distinctive
- Should subtly relate to marketing/AI/systems concepts

**Research component:**
- Study Spanish colonial place-naming patterns in Americas

- Don't have literal meaning but evoke quality/capability/systems
- Differentiate sharply from generic AI tool names
- Could work as invented words or obscure references

**Consider:**
- Latin/Greek roots

## Success Criteria

**Research is successful if:**
1. ✅ Generated 15-25 diverse name candidates across 5 strategic approaches
2. ✅ All candidates evaluated against brand strategy (positioning, pillars, voice)
3. ✅ Top candidates checked for domain/trademark feasibility
4. ✅ Clear top 3 recommendations with strategic rationale
5. ✅ Implementation guidance provided for transition from "vibeflow"
6. ✅ Names honor Alavida's Spanish-American roots while supporting Marketing Architecture positioning
7. ✅ At least 1 recommended name feels authentically differentiated from competitor naming patterns

---

## Research Integrity Notes

- This is ad-hoc research (doesn't update a domain index)
- Will use web research for Spanish language exploration and competitor name benchmarking
- Will check domain/trademark databases for feasibility
- Primary sources: brand strategy documents, linguistic research, trademark databases
- Naming is subjective—focus on defensible rationale, not "perfect" answers

**Plan Status:** Ready for implementation
**Next Step:** Run `/implement` to execute this research plan
