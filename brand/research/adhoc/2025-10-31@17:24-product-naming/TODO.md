## Summary

**Key Outcome:** Generated 26 name candidates across 5 strategic approaches, evaluated against comprehensive brand criteria, and conducted feasibility research. Feasibility eliminated 3 top candidates (Substrate, Tectonic, Arcova) due to domain/trademark conflicts. Final recommendation: **TECTARA** (10/10 feasibility, 8.8/10 brand) with CIMIENTO and MERCADA as conditional alternatives pending domain verification.

**Top 3 Recommendations:**
1. **TECTARA** (RECOMMENDED) - Greek "tekton" (builder) + Romance elegance, zero conflicts, fastest path to market
2. **CIMIENTO** - Spanish "foundation," highest brand score (9.1/10), requires domain verification
3. **MERCADA** - Invented Spanish form, strongest Alavida cohesion, requires domain verification

**Final Output:** [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md)

## Current Phase

**COMPLETED** - All phases executed successfully. Research ready for strategic decision and implementation.

## Notes

**Naming Requirements:**
- Honor Alavida's Spanish-American cultural roots (like Los Angeles, Florida, Sacramento)
- Convey marketing and/or AI meaning (directly or abstractly)
- Support "Marketing Architecture" category positioning
- Align with brand pillars: ownership, capability, systems-building, quality
- Must be ownable (trademark/domain availability)

**Target Output:** 15-25 name candidates across 5 strategies, evaluated and ranked, with top 3 recommendations and implementation guidance.

**Current Placeholder:** "Vibeflow" (no longer viable - taken and doesn't fit strategic positioning)
