## Context

Alavida is preparing for its first major marketing campaign with specific objectives:

- Engage with communities
- Create social media content
- **Primary goal:** Land 2 more clients

The Marketing Architect needs to identify the single most valuable book to read that will provide actionable guidance for this specific situation.

---

## Research Objective

Identify **the single best book** that will provide the most actionable, relevant guidance for:
1. B2B client acquisition in technical/consulting services
2. First marketing campaign execution
3. Community engagement and social media content strategy
4. Practical, implementable frameworks (not theory-heavy)

---

## Research Approach

### Phase 1: Define Selection Criteria

Establish weighted criteria based on Alavida's specific needs:
- **Relevance to B2B client acquisition** (30%) - Must address landing enterprise/B2B clients
- **Actionability** (25%) - Practical frameworks, not abstract theory
- **Community/content focus** (20%) - Covers social media, community building, content strategy
- **Stage appropriateness** (15%) - Suitable for first marketing campaign (not scaled operations)
- **Time-to-value** (10%) - Can be read and applied quickly

### Phase 2: Candidate Identification

Research 8-12 highly-regarded marketing books across categories:
- **Category positioning** (e.g., "Obviously Awesome" by April Dunford)
- **Content marketing** (e.g., "They Ask, You Answer" by Marcus Sheridan)
- **Community-led growth** (e.g., "The Business of Belonging" by David Spinks)
- **B2B sales/marketing** (e.g., "The Challenger Sale," "Predictable Revenue")
- **Modern marketing systems** (e.g., "$100M Offers" by Alex Hormozi, "Traction" by Weinberg/Mares)

### Phase 3: Evidence Collection

For each candidate book, gather:
1. **Core framework/methodology** - What system does it teach?
2. **Applicability to Alavida's situation** - How well does it map to current needs?
3. **Practitioner validation** - Reviews from B2B founders/marketers who've applied it
4. **Time investment vs. output** - Reading time vs. implementable takeaways
5. **Specific relevance to client acquisition** - Does it directly address landing clients?

### Phase 4: Comparative Analysis

Create scoring matrix using weighted criteria to identify the single best recommendation with clear rationale.
