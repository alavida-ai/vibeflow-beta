## Universal Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity First

- One idea per sentence
- Concrete over abstract

### 2. Active Voice
- "We help you..." not "You are helped by..."
- Subject → Verb → Object

### 3. Conversational
- Write like you talk (professionally)
- Use "you" and "we"
- OK to start sentences with "And" or "But"

## Vocabulary

### Words We Use

### Words We Avoid
