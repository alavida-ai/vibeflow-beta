# Brand Strategy Navigation

## Overview
This directory contains our brand's strategic foundation - the versioned source of truth that guides all marketing execution. These documents are synthesized from research and updated periodically (typically quarterly).

## Quick Navigation

### Core Identity

### Messaging

- **Extensions** (`extensions/*.md`): Platform or context-specific adaptations

Example:
- `tone-of-voice/index.md` - How we sound everywhere
- `tone-of-voice/extensions/twitter.md` - How we adapt for Twitter
