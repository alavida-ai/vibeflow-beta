## Channel Considerations

This voice strategy provides the foundation for all brand communications. For platform-specific voice adaptations, see extensions:

- [Twitter voice extension](twitter/EXTENSION.md) (when available)
- [LinkedIn voice extension](linkedin/EXTENSION.md) (when available)
- [Email voice extension](email/EXTENSION.md) (when available)

**Note:** Extensions build upon this base voice - they don't replace it. Platform adaptations maintain core voice attributes while optimizing for channel conventions.
