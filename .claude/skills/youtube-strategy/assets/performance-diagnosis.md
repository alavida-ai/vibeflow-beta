# Performance Diagnosis: Decision Tree for Underperforming Videos

## Step 1: Check CTR (First 24 Hours)

**Is CTR below 2-3%?**

- [ ] **YES** → Packaging is the issue → Go to Packaging Fixes
- [ ] **NO** → CTR is OK → Go to Step 2

## Step 2: Check Retention (AVD)

**Is retention below 30%?**

- [ ] **YES** → Content is the issue → Go to Retention Fixes
- [ ] **NO** → Retention is OK → Your video is performing well

## Packaging Fixes (Low CTR)

**Problem:** Title or thumbnail not compelling enough

**Quick fixes:**
1. Regenerate 5-10 new titles, pick stronger one
2. Create 2-3 new thumbnail variations
3. Re-upload using Studio editor (don't delete/reupload)

**Timeline:**
- If CTR still low by 12 hours, try new title
- If still low by 24 hours, try new thumbnail
- If still low, format may be fundamentally unappealing

## Retention Fixes (Low AVD)

**Problem:** Content not delivering on hook promise

**Diagnose where drop-off occurs:**
1. Check retention curve (which minute sees drop-off?)
2. What happens at that moment in video?
3. Is there a retention killer (conclusion language, slow section)?

**Fixes based on drop-off point:**

**Drop-off at 0-1 min:** Hook issue
- Fix: Stronger opening, faster payoff confirmation

**Drop-off at 5-10 min:** Mid-video engagement lost
- Fix: Pattern interrupt, new curiosity loop

**Drop-off at 90%+:** Ending issue
- Fix: Stronger conclusion, better payoff

## Both CTR and Retention Low

**Problem:** Fundamental issue (idea, packaging, or content quality)

**Decision:**
- Is this format worth pursuing? (Consider 3+ videos data)
- Can the idea be repositioned? (Different angle/packaging)
- Should this be scrapped? (Learn and move on)

## No Issues Found

**Problem:** This is actually a good video!

**Next steps:**
- Cross-promote on community tab
- Add to playlist for discovery
- Let it be a digital asset (accumulates views over time)
- Replicate this format for future videos

**Use this whenever a video underperforms to diagnose and fix systematically.**
