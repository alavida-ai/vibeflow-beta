# Idea Elimination Criteria: Validation Framework

Use before creating any video. If it fails any criterion, scrap the idea.

## Feasibility Check
**Can you actually create this video?**
- [ ] Required footage/access available?
- [ ] Within your skill level to produce?
- [ ] Can film/edit within reasonable time?
- [ ] Resources available (budget, equipment, location)?

If NO to any: Scrap idea or modify to make feasible.

## Excitement Check  
**Are you genuinely passionate about this?**
- [ ] Excited about creating this?
- [ ] Could talk about this for months?
- [ ] Sustainable without external hype?
- [ ] Aligns with your values/expertise?

If NO: Scrap idea (burnout risk too high).

## Packaging Check
**Can you create a good title and thumbnail?**
- [ ] Can you think of a compelling title?
- [ ] Can you visualize a click-worthy thumbnail?
- [ ] Does it create a curiosity gap?
- [ ] Does packaging pass the glance test?

If NO: Scrap idea (no ceiling for views).

## View Target Check
**Is the view potential realistic for your niche?**
- [ ] What's the TAM ceiling for this topic?
- [ ] Is your view target realistic given TAM?
- [ ] Does this align with channel size?
- [ ] Achievable without viral luck?

If NO: Scrap or modify to increase TAM.

## CCN Fit Check
**Does it appeal to Core, Casual, and New viewers?**
- [ ] Core viewers interested? (yes = baseline)
- [ ] Casual viewers interested? (some appeal required)
- [ ] New viewers interested? (universal enough?)
- [ ] Feasible to balance all three?

If idea only appeals to Core: Modify for broader appeal.

## Final Decision
- All 5 criteria passed? → **CREATE VIDEO**
- 1+ criteria failed? → **SCRAP OR MODIFY**

*Ideas that fail elimination criteria will underperform. Better to skip bad ideas than waste time creating doomed videos.*
