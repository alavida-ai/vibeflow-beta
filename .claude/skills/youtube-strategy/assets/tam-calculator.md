# TAM Calculator: Total Addressable Market Research Workflow

## Step 1: Search Your Niche

1. **Open YouTube**
2. **Search:** [Your topic/niche]
3. **Look at results** - Note what comes up

## Step 2: Filter by Video Length

1. **Click filters** (under search bar)
2. **Video length:** Select "Long (20 min+)"
3. **Why:** Longer videos = more competitive, more serious creators

## Step 3: Sort by Most Viewed

1. **Sort by:** "Most viewed"
2. **Note the view count** on top 5-10 videos
3. **Find the ceiling** - What's the highest views you see?

## Step 4: Calculate TAM

**TAM Ceiling = Highest view count on any video in niche**

Example:
- Search "productivity tips"
- Top video: 5,000,000 views
- TAM ceiling: 5M views

## Step 5: Set Realistic Target

**Your realistic target = TAM × (Your channel stage)**

| Channel Stage | Formula | Example |
|---|---|---|
| New (0-1K subs) | TAM × 1-5% | 5M × 3% = 150K views |
| Improving (1K-10K) | TAM × 5-20% | 5M × 10% = 500K views |
| Optimized (10K+) | TAM × 20-100% | 5M × 50% = 2.5M views |

## Step 6: Outlier Research

1. **Use:** oneoften.com or viewstats
2. **Find:** Videos getting 3X+ above channel average
3. **Analyze:** What's different about these videos?
4. **Pattern:** Common format? Topic? Angle?

## Step 7: Adjacent Niche Mining

1. **Search adjacent niche** (related but different)
2. **Identify successful formats** in adjacent niche
3. **Adapt to your niche** (keep format, change topic)
4. **Example:** Golf channel → Adapt fishing channel's format
