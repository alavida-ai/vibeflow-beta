## Viewing Your Retention Curve

**Steps:**
1. Open YouTube Studio
2. Go to Analytics → Reach features → Audience retention
3. View retention curve graph
4. Identify where viewers drop off

## Marking Drop-Off Points

**Mark on curve:**
- [ ] 0-1 min: Any early exits?
- [ ] 25%: Do viewers stay through 1/4?
- [ ] 50%: Do viewers make it to halfway?
- [ ] 75%: Do viewers stay to 3/4?
- [ ] 100%: Full watch percentage?

**Rate severity: 1-5 (5 = major drop)**

## Hypothesis: Why Did They Leave?

**At each drop-off point, ask:**

**If drop-off at 0-1 min:**
- Was hook weak?
- Packaging over-promised?
- Opening too slow?
- Viewers confused about topic?

**If drop-off at 25-50%:**
- Lost momentum?
- Confusing explanation?
- Content not matching promise?
- Pacing too slow?

**If drop-off at 75%+:**
- Weak payoff?
- Didn't deliver full promise?
- Anticlimactic ending?
- Slow conclusion?

## What Happens at Drop-Off Moments?

**Review your video:**
1. Play to first major drop-off point
2. What's happening on screen?
3. What's the audio/music?
4. Is there a retention killer?

**Identify:**
- [ ] Scene transition point?
- [ ] Topic shift?
- [ ] Explanation too complex?
- [ ] Pacing too slow?
- [ ] Conclusion language used?
