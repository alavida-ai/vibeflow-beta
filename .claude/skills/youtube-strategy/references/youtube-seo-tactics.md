# YouTube SEO Tactics: Search Optimization and Discovery

## TAM (Total Addressable Market) Research

### Calculating the Ceiling
1. **Search your niche** on YouTube
2. **Filter by video length** (longer = more competitive)
3. **Sort by "most viewed"** to find ceiling
4. **Note the view count** = realistic ceiling for your videos

Example: Search "productivity tips" → Top video has 5M views = TAM ceiling

### Outlier Identification
Use tools (oneoften.com, viewstats, TubeBuddy) to find videos performing 3X+ above channel average.

### Adjacent Niche Mining
Study vertical/related niches. How can you adapt their successful formats?

## Keyword Research for YouTube

**YouTube prioritizes:**
- Titles and descriptions (more than tags)
- Viewer satisfaction signals (CTR, retention)
- Recent uploads (slight recency bonus)

**Don't prioritize:**
- Tags (minimal impact)
- Keyword density (manipulation tactics don't work)
- Exact match keywords (YouTube understands intent)

## Title, Description, Tag Optimization

### Title
- Include main keyword early
- Prioritize human appeal first
- 50-60 characters optimal
- Write 30-40 variations, pick best

### Description
- First 2-3 lines appear before "more"
- Include keyword naturally
- Useful information (timestamps, links, credits)
- Don't keyword-stuff

### Tags
- Primary keyword tag
- 5-10 relevant tags
- Supportive only (not primary optimization)

## Search Intent Matching (CCN Fit)

- **Core searches:** Niche-specific ("D1 athlete training")
- **Casual searches:** Broader interest ("athletic training")  
- **New searches:** Widest appeal ("how to get fit")

Match content to search intent level.

## Balancing SEO with Clickability

**Rule:** Optimize for humans first, SEO second.

- Title for human curiosity > keyword optimization
- Description for usefulness > keyword density
- Tags as supportive only

High CTR matters more than search ranking.

## Long-Tail vs Broad Keywords

**Broad:** "Productivity" (high competition, hard to rank)
**Long-tail:** "How to manage ADHD productivity" (lower competition, niche audience)

Strategy: Rank for long-tail (easier to win) while attracting broad audience through quality.

**Core:** TAM research sets realistic ceiling. Write for humans, get found naturally. Don't sacrifice CTR for search ranking.
