# Discovery Optimization: Suggested Videos and Browse Features

## The 80% Overlap Rule

**Critical for suggested videos:** Your videos must appeal to 80%+ of the same audience.

**Why:** Algorithm serves suggested videos to viewers watching similar content. No overlap = no suggestion.

**Implementation:**
- Map audience across your videos
- Identify 80%+ overlap zones
- Create content coherent enough for suggestions
- Maintain some consistency in topic/format

## Suggested Video Mechanics

Algorithm asks: "What should viewer watch next?"

**Factors:**
- Viewer watch history (what have they watched?)
- Your channel's audience overlap
- Session time on similar content  
- Viewer satisfaction signals
- Familiarity + novelty balance

**Optimization:**
- Make viewers comfortable watching multiple of YOUR videos
- Slight format variation within coherent theme
- Bingeability (viewers watch 2-3 videos in session)

## Browse Feature Optimization

**Algorithm question:** "Should I show this in home feed now?"

**Factors:**
- Trending/timely relevance
- Viewer's previous interests
- Packaging clarity (glance test)
- Content popularity/novelty

**Optimization:**
- Thumbnail passes glance test (high contrast, 3 focus areas)
- Title clear and appealing
- CCN Fit (appeals to Core, Casual, New viewers)

## Session Time Importance

**Session time = total watch time + follow-on videos**

Algorithm promotion increases when:
- Viewer watches your video fully (100% retention ideal)
- Viewer watches another of your videos after
- Total session time is long

**Optimization:**
- End screens + cards direct to next video
- Series/playlists encourage binge watching
- Community posts keep engaged viewers active
- Consistent quality maintains session time

## Bingeable Content Creation

**What makes viewers watch multiple videos:**
1. **Format consistency** (know what to expect)
2. **Series structure** (part 1, part 2, etc.)
3. **Quality consistency** (all videos deliver)
4. **Narrative connection** (callbacks, references to other videos)

**Implementation:**
- Develop signature format
- Series within your channel
- End-screen suggesting next logical video
- Callbacks to previous videos

## Leveraging Trending Topics

**Trending helps with:**
- Initial velocity (early impressions)
- Browse placement (timely content)
- Short-term views surge

**Problem:**
- Trend dies, views drop
- Not sustainable long-term

**Strategy:** 
Use trends tactically (10-20% of content) while building evergreen foundation (80% of content).

## Viewer Behavior Patterns

**YouTube viewers:**
- Session watch (not single video)
- Binge if format consistent
- Return if satisfied
- Suggest to others if surprised and delighted

**Optimization:**
- Optimize for session, not individual video
- Build series and formats
- Deliver on promises
- Create shareable moments

**Core:** 80% overlap for suggestions, consistent formats for bingeability, full session time optimization for algorithmic promotion.
