# Common Mistakes: Failure Patterns and Prevention Strategies

## Packaging Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Core-Only Content
- **Problem:** Title/thumbnail optimized only for core audience
- **Example:** "D1 athlete preparation protocol" (niche language)
- **Result:** New viewers don't click
- **Fix:** Use universal language with niche application

### Mistake 2: Glance Test Failure
- **Problem:** Thumbnail requires thinking to understand
- **Example:** Complex composition, small text, blended colors
- **Result:** Viewers scroll past without clicking
- **Fix:** 3 focus areas max, high contrast, <1 second comprehension

### Mistake 3: Information Overload
- **Problem:** Thumbnail tries to communicate too much
- **Result:** Cognitive overload = viewers scroll past
- **Fix:** One clear central subject + supporting element

### Mistake 4: Misleading Packaging
- **Problem:** Title/thumbnail promise video can't deliver
- **Result:** Retention collapse, trust damage
- **Fix:** Exaggerate appeal, don't exaggerate facts

## Retention Killers

### Mistake 5: Slow Intro
- **Problem:** Taking too long to confirm click promise
- **Example:** 30 seconds of context before content starts
- **Result:** Viewers leave in first 30 seconds
- **Fix:** Confirm packaging promise in first 7 seconds

### Mistake 6: Conclusion Language
- **Problem:** Using words that signal the end
- **Example:** "To recap...", "At the end of the day..."
- **Result:** Viewers exit when they hear conclusion signal
- **Fix:** Avoid conclusion language until actual ending

### Mistake 7: Dead Air / Silence
- **Problem:** Lack of pattern interrupts
- **Result:** Attention drift, viewer departure
- **Fix:** New visual or audio every 15-30 seconds

### Mistake 8: Tangents and Confusion
- **Problem:** Unclear progress toward promised payoff
- **Result:** Viewers get lost, leave
- **Fix:** Clear structure, maintain focus, progress toward conclusion

## Strategy Mistakes

### Mistake 9: Niche Jumping
- **Problem:** Inconsistent content across videos
- **Result:** <80% audience overlap, no suggested videos
- **Fix:** Maintain coherence, 80% same topic, 20% experimental

### Mistake 10: Perfection Paralysis
- **Problem:** Never publishing because waiting for perfect
- **Result:** No videos, no channel growth
- **Fix:** Publish good enough, improve through iteration

### Mistake 11: Ignoring Analytics
- **Problem:** Not studying what works, why it works
- **Result:** Repeating mistakes, missing patterns
- **Fix:** Regular outlier analysis (top 10% study)

### Mistake 12: One-Off Content
- **Problem:** Creating random videos without series/format
- **Result:** No subscription reason, no repeat viewers
- **Fix:** Build signature formats, series structure

## Mindset Mistakes

### Mistake 13: Algorithm Chasing
- **Problem:** Trying to "hack" algorithm with tactics
- **Result:** Burnout, inauthentic content
- **Fix:** Focus on viewer value, algorithm follows

### Mistake 14: Impatience
- **Problem:** Giving up before month 4 (establishment phase)
- **Result:** Channel dies before growth begins
- **Fix:** Commit to 12-month framework, accept learning curve

### Mistake 15: Production Over Pre-Production
- **Problem:** Spending 95% time on production, 5% on packaging
- **Result:** Great content, terrible discoverability
- **Fix:** 30% ideation/packaging, 70% production

- [ ] Title under 60 chars, human-first language
- [ ] First 7 seconds confirm packaging
- [ ] New hook by 30 seconds
- [ ] No retention killers identified
- [ ] Video delivers on promise
- [ ] 80% overlap with channel coherence
