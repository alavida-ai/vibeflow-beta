# Publishing Strategy: Upload Timing, Frequency, and Launch

## Phase-Based Cadence

### Establishment Phase (Months 1-4): 2x Per Week
- Build skills and confidence
- Volume = reps
- Don't worry about optimal timing
- Focus on consistency signal
- Goal: Reach 1K subs + 50 videos

### Improvement Phase (Months 5-8): 1x Per Week
- Quality > quantity
- Algorithm notices improvement
- More editing time per video
- Audience expects regular uploads
- Goal: Reach 10K subs + quality baseline

### Optimization Phase (Months 9+): Strategic
- Publish when ready, not on schedule
- Quality always > arbitrary cadence
- Can publish 2x week or 2x month as needed
- Audience loyal enough for variable schedule

## Upload Timing Considerations

### For New Channels:
- Timing matters less than consistency
- Upload on same day/time (builds expectation)
- Pick schedule you can sustain

### For Established Channels:
- Early morning uploads may have slight edge (catch waking viewers)
- Time zone matters less (YouTube watches 24/7)
- Consistency trumps timing

## Initial Velocity (First 24 Hours)

### Why First 24 Hours Matter
- Algorithm tests video with small audience first
- Strong CTR in first 24hr = expanded distribution
- First hour CTR especially strong signal

### Launch Activation
- **Community posts** - Alert subscribers
- **Notifications** - Enabled subscribers see immediately
- **Social media** - Drive external viewers
- **Stories/clips** - Tease the video
- **Direct messages** - To engaged community

**Goal:** Get 100+ views in first hour to signal quality to algorithm.

## Batch Creation Strategy

### Ideation Phase (Separate from Production)
- Generate 100+ ideas per week (dedicated time)
- Apply elimination criteria
- Build 4-week idea backlog

### Production Phase (Separate from Ideation)
- Batch film 2-4 videos in single session
- Reduces context switching
- Increases efficiency
- Reduces decision fatigue

### Publishing (Automated if Possible)
- Schedule uploads in advance
- Maintain consistent cadence
- Reduces stress

## Cadence by Channel Size

| Stage | Subscribers | Cadence | Strategy |
|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| Establishment | 0-1K | 2x/week | Consistency > timing |
| Improvement | 1K-10K | 1x/week | Quality focus |
| Optimization | 10K+ | Strategic | Quality always |
| Scale | 100K+ | Variable | Loyal audience |

## Burnout Prevention

**Sustainability is key:**
- Don't commit to cadence you can't maintain
- Batch production reduces daily workload
- Scheduled uploads = reduced stress
- Move to 1x/week post-month 4

**Better 1 great video per week than 2 mediocre videos.**

**Core:** Establish consistency, improve quality, optimize strategically. Batch creation reduces burnout. First 24 hours matter for algorithmic push.
