# Hook Tactics: Writing and Executing Effective Video Hooks

## Hook Formulas

### Cold Open
- Start with action or surprise
- No introduction
- Example: "Watch this..." (shows shocking moment)

### Teaser
- Preview what's coming
- Example: "You won't believe what happens at 2:30"

### Preview 
- Show the answer, then explain how
- Example: "Here's how to make $1M" (then explain method)

### Pattern Interrupt
- Unexpected shift (music, cut, B-roll)
- Breaks monotony
- Recaptures attention

### Question Hook
- Ask question viewer wants answer to
- Example: "Do you know why Netflix succeeded?"

## First 7 Seconds Execution

**Goal:** Confirm packaging promise

1. **Show what was promised** (same visual from thumbnail)
2. **State the topic** (make it crystal clear)
3. **Give reason to stay** (what's the benefit?)

**Formula:**
"[Show promised element]. Today we're [topic]. [Benefit statement]."

## Next 23 Seconds: New Curiosity

**Goal:** Create reason to keep watching

**Techniques:**
- Tease coming revelation
- Show consequence/benefit
- Introduce mystery
- Pattern interrupt

**Example:** 
- 0-7 sec: Confirm $1M claim with evidence
- 8-30 sec: "But how did they actually do it? (pause) It's not what you think..."

## Content Type Hooks

### Educational
- "In the next 10 minutes, you'll learn..."
- Lead with value proposition
- Show real-world application

### Entertainment
- Open with action/reaction
- Surprise early (build curiosity)
- Pattern interrupt immediately

### Documentary  
- Establish stakes ("You've probably never seen this")
- Show exclusive element
- Create sense of privilege

## Common Hook Mistakes

**Slow intro:** Information before hook (viewer leaves)
**Unnecessary context:** Too much setup (viewer gets bored)
**Unclear hook:** Doesn't answer "why should I watch?"
**No new curiosity:** Hook confirms, but nothing new to watch for

## Hook Patterns by Niche

- Educational: Expert credibility + clear value
- Entertainment: Action + surprise + reaction
- Business: Problem statement + counterintuitive solution
- Lifestyle: Aspiration + relatability
- Comedy: Setup + punchline + callback

**Core:** 7 seconds to confirm, 23 to create new curiosity. Hooks are 20-30% of editing effort because they determine everything.
