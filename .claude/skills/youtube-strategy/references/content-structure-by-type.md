# Content Structure by Type: Type-Specific Frameworks

## Educational/Tutorial

**Structure:** Commentary/talking head + demonstrations
**Best practice:** Clear expertise + novel insight + step-by-step
**Packaging:** Title emphasizes value ("Master [skill] in 10 min")
**Hook:** Expert credibility + clear learning outcome
**Common mistake:** Too focused on deep niche (alienates newcomers)
**Fix:** Frame educationally for New viewers, but satisfy Core depth

## Entertainment/Action

**Structure:** Action-forward with reaction or commentary
**Best practice:** Show situation unfolding, capture genuine reaction
**Packaging:** Title emphasizes surprise/action
**Hook:** Action immediately, new curiosity by 30 sec
**Common mistake:** Spending too long on setup
**Fix:** Action first, context as needed

## Documentary/Storytelling

**Structure:** Narrative arc with exclusive access/angles
**Best practice:** Build stakes, reveal progressively, end with insight
**Packaging:** Superlatives ("world's," "never before seen")
**Hook:** Establish exclusive angle, create sense of privilege
**Common mistake:** Slow pacing loses viewers
**Fix:** Vary pacing, use pattern interrupts

## Listicles/Comparisons

**Structure:** 3-12 items, ranked or compared
**Best practice:** "Puzzle list" for <10 items (each connects to next)
**Packaging:** Title says list type ("Top 10," "$1 vs $10 vs $100")
**Hook:** Tease the comparison or preview answer
**Format:** Clear numbering, consistent item structure
**Best variation:** Three-step comparison ($1/$10/$100)

## Long-Form (30min+)

**Structure:** Strong chapter breaks, multiple retention curves
**Best practice:** Analyze retention per segment, eliminate danger zones
**Packaging:** Promise significant payoff (worth 30+ minutes)
**Hook:** Strong, multiple hooks throughout (not just start)
**Strategy:** Optimize for TV device viewing (bigger screen)
**Common mistake:** Failing to re-engage after 10-min mark
**Fix:** New hook/curiosity loop every 5-10 minutes

## Interviews/Conversations

**Structure:** Recurring format, guest expertise + host perspective
**Best practice:** Frame guest by archetype, not name ("NFL player's life" not "John Smith")
**Packaging:** Descriptor emphasizing broad appeal ("The Mozart of Gen Z")
**Hook:** Establish why this guest matters (not just introduction)
**Format:** Repeatable structure for consistency
**Growth:** Format consistency allows algorithm to predict and serve viewers

---

All types benefit from: Strong hook (0-30 sec), promise delivery (body), and payoff satisfaction.
