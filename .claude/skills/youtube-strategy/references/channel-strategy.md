# Channel Strategy: 12-Month Growth Framework and Content Planning

## The 12-Month Growth Framework

### Establishment (Months 1-4)
**Goal:** Define niche, build skills, reach 1K subs

**Strategy:**
- Narrow niche focus (easier to dominate)
- 2x/week posting (volume for skill)
- Test core format
- Accumulate 50+ videos
- Focus: Consistency > Results

**Success:** 1K subs, baseline quality, signature format identified

### Improvement (Months 5-8)  
**Goal:** Identify winners, reach 10K subs

**Strategy:**
- 1x/week quality focus
- 100 ideas/week generation
- 3+ thumbnails per video
- Outlier analysis (study top 10%)
- Expand adjacent niches
- Maintain 80%+ overlap

**Success:** 10K subs, top 10% formats identified, audience growth acceleration

### Optimization (Months 9-12+)
**Goal:** Scale winners, reach 100K+ subs

**Strategy:**
- Sniper approach (replicate top 10%)
- Strategic publishing (quality-driven)
- Higher production investment OK
- Formula refinement
- Format innovation (20% experimental)

**Success:** 100K subs, predictable performance, sustainable growth

## Content Bucket Strategy

### Core Content (60-70%)
- Proven winning formats
- High consistency
- Reliable audience response
- Main channel identity

### Growth Content (20-25%)
- Broader appeal than core
- Attracts New viewers
- Introduces adjacent topics
- Tests expansion directions

### Experimental Content (5-10%)
- High-risk, high-reward
- Format innovation
- Adjacent niche exploration
- "What if" testing

## The 80% Overlap Rule for Bingeability

**Why 80% matters:**
- Viewers suggested multiple of your videos
- Session time increases
- Algorithm recognizes sticky channel

**Implementation:**
- Map audience coherence across videos
- 80% should be coherent audience
- 20% can be experimental/different

**Example:**
- Core audience: Business education (80%)
- Experimental: Lifestyle content (20%)

## Evergreen vs Trending Content Balance

### Evergreen (80% focus)
- Content relevant forever
- Compounds views over time
- "Digital assets on internet"
- Example: "How to master skill X"

### Trending (20% focus)  
- Timely topics
- Initial velocity boost
- Views fade as trend dies
- Example: "React to today's event"

**Strategy:** Build foundation on evergreen, use trends tactically for growth spikes.

## Portfolio Approach

### High-Risk/High-Reward Content
- Experimental formats
- New topics
- Innovation plays
- 10-20% of portfolio

### Consistent Performers
- Proven formats
- Reliable views
- Built audience trust
- 70-80% of portfolio

**Balance:** Enough innovation to discover next growth vector, but consistency to maintain audience.

## Sniper Approach (Identify Winners)

**Process:**
1. Identify top 10% of videos (by performance)
2. What patterns do they share?
3. Are formats replicable?
4. Can you create variations?
5. Double down on winners

**Example:**
- Top videos all educational comparisons
- Sniper approach: Create more comparison formats
- Variation: Different products, same format
- Result: Predictable, scalable growth

## Channel Positioning and Evolution

### Starting Position
- Specific niche (easier to win)
- Clear audience (Core + early Casual)
- Signature format

### Evolution Path
- Month 4-8: Expand adjacent topics (maintain 80% overlap)
- Month 8-12: Test broader appeal (20% experimental)
- Month 12+: Gradual niche expansion as audience grows

**Don't abandon core audience as you expand.**

## Niche Coherence and 80% Rule

**Coherent channel (80% overlap):**
- Viewers watch multiple videos
- Algorithm suggests your content
- Session time high
- Growth accelerates

**Incoherent channel (<80% overlap):**
- Viewers don't watch follow-up videos
- Algorithm can't categorize
- Session time low
- Growth stalls

---

**Core:** Establish narrow niche → Improve and expand → Optimize proven formats. Balance 80% consistency with 20% innovation. Maintain audience coherence.
