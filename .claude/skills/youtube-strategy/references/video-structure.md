# Video Structure: Hook-Body-Payoff Architecture

## The Hook-Body-Payoff Framework

### Hook (First 30 Seconds)
- **First 7 seconds:** Confirm packaging promise ("respect the click")
  - Show what thumbnail promised (same person, object, situation)
  - Use same visual framing as thumbnail
  - State topic or show payoff setup
  - Build viewer confidence in click decision

- **Next 23 seconds:** Create new curiosity loop
  - Introduce next reason to keep watching
  - Pattern interrupt (shift focus, B-roll, music change)
  - "But wait, there's more..." (tease what's coming)
  - Prevent early exit

**Investment:** Allocate 20-30% of total editing time to first minute

### Body (The Delivery)
- Deliver on promise from packaging
- Maintain momentum and pacing
- Use pattern interrupts (B-roll, cuts, graphics, music shifts)
- Avoid retention killers (slow sections, unclear progress)
- Build toward payoff

**Retention killers to avoid:**
- Language signaling conclusion ("to recap," "at the end of the day," "nevertheless")
- Dead air or silence
- Slow pacing in key sections
- Confusing explanations

### Payoff (Resolution)
- Satisfy viewer expectation from packaging
- Deliver on all promises made
- Respect viewer's time investment
- Leave viewers satisfied (not manipulated)

## Retention Curve Analysis

### What the Curve Reveals

- **High plateau:** Viewers stick with content
- **Dips:** Specific moments viewers drop off
- **Cliff drops:** Major retention killers
- **Recovery:** Content re-engages after dips

### Danger Zones to Identify

1. **Slow intros** - Viewers leave before content starts
2. **Conclusion language** - "To wrap up..." signals end, triggers exit
3. **Complex explanations** - Loss of clarity causes departures
4. **Pace changes** - Unexplained slowing loses momentum
5. **Tangents** - Off-topic sections confuse purpose

## First Minute Importance

### Time Allocation
- 20-30% of total editing time on first minute
- 7 seconds for click confirmation
- 23 seconds for new hook setup
- Rest of video: remaining 70-80% of editing time

### Strategic Investment
The first minute determines:
- Whether viewer stays
- Whether algorithm promotes (retention curve shapes distribution)
- Whether video compounds or plateaus

**Better to spend 3 hours editing first minute than 3 hours optimizing minute 20.**

## Pacing Strategies

### Fast Pacing (Action Content)
- Quick cuts (1-3 seconds per shot)
- Music drives energy
- B-roll provides visual interest
- Keeps attention high

### Slow Pacing (Educational Content)
- Allow time for comprehension
- Clear explanations (not rushed)
- Breathing room (not overwhelming)
- But maintain momentum (no dead air)

### Variable Pacing (Best Practice)
- Mix fast and slow sections
- Use slow for clarity, fast for energy
- Contrast keeps engagement (monotony kills)
- Pattern interrupts every 15-30 seconds

## Content Type Structure Variations

**Core Principle:** Hook viewers in 30 seconds, deliver promise in body, satisfy expectation in payoff. Pacing and pattern interrupts maintain engagement throughout.
