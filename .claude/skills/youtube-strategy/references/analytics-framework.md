# Analytics Framework: Metrics That Matter and Performance Diagnosis

## Metrics Hierarchy

### CTR (Click-Through Rate) - PRIMARY SIGNAL
- What: Percentage of impressions that become clicks
- When: First hour, first 24 hours most critical
- Meaning: Packaging effectiveness (titles, thumbnails)
- Target: 4-8% strong, 2-4% acceptable, <2% needs improvement

### Retention/AVD (Average View Duration) - DELIVERY SIGNAL  
- What: Percentage of video viewers watch on average
- Meaning: Content quality and delivery on promise
- Target: 50%+ excellent, 30-50% good, <30% needs work
- Impact: 5% improvement = massive view increase

### Viewer Satisfaction - ENGAGEMENT SIGNAL
- Likes (not critical but indicator)
- Comments (sentiment indicator, no algo weight)
- Skip rate (if viewers skip back, content complex)

### Session Time - PROMOTION SIGNAL
- Total watch time (your video + viewer's following behavior)
- Follow-on viewing (do viewers watch more of yours?)
- Indicator of channel stickiness

## Performance Diagnosis Matrix

**High CTR + High Retention:**
- Status: Winner
- Meaning: Packaging works, content delivers
- Action: Replicate this format

**High CTR + Low Retention:**
- Status: Over-promise, under-deliver
- Meaning: Packaging too strong, content disappoints
- Action: Align promise with delivery, improve hook/body

**Low CTR + High Retention:**
- Status: Great content, poor packaging
- Meaning: Content excellent, but not reaching audience
- Action: Improve title/thumbnail, relaunch if possible

**Low CTR + Low Retention:**
- Status: Fundamental issue
- Meaning: Idea, packaging, or core content flawed
- Action: Evaluate if worth continuing; likely scrap format

## TAM Benchmarking

### Setting Realistic Targets

1. **Research TAM ceiling** (top video in niche views)
2. **Account for channel stage:**
   - New channel: expect 1-5% of TAM
   - Established: expect 5-50% of TAM
   - Optimized: expect 25-100% of TAM
3. **Set incremental targets** (not TAM from day 1)

### Example
- Niche ceiling: 1M views
- Your channel: 10K subs
- Realistic target: 10K-100K views (1-10% of TAM)

## Outlier Analysis

**Process:**
1. Identify top 10% of your videos (by views/performance)
2. What do they have in common?
3. Format similarity? Topic? Thumbnail style? Title pattern?
4. Replicate the pattern

**This is more valuable than "average" analysis.**

## Common Analytics Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Low CTR isn't a real problem
- Reality: CTR is the strongest predictor of success

**Mistake 2:** Retention doesn't matter if CTR is high  
- Reality: Both required. High CTR only sets potential ceiling.

**Mistake 3:** Views = success
- Reality: Type of views matters. Evergreen > viral.

**Mistake 4:** One video defines your strategy
- Reality: Look at patterns across 10+ videos.

**Core:** CTR shows packaging strength. Retention shows content quality. Both required. Use analytics to identify what works and replicate.
