### Cross-Domain Relationships

**Primary Knowledge Flows:**

1. **Algorithm → All Domains**
   - Algorithm understanding informs every tactical decision
   - E.g., "Why does this thumbnail tactic work? Because it increases CTR, which signals value to the algorithm"

2. **Psychology → Packaging (Thumbnail + Title)**
   - Psychological triggers inform thumbnail and title decisions
   - E.g., "Curiosity gaps work because of the information gap theory"

3. **Packaging → Video Structure**
   - Thumbnail + Title create a promise that the video must deliver
   - E.g., "Hook must connect to packaging promise, payoff must satisfy it"

4. **Analytics → Iteration**
   - Metrics reveal which tactics are working
   - E.g., "Low CTR → revisit thumbnail/title strategy, Low AVD → revisit structure/hook"

5. **Audience Psychology → Growth Strategy**
   - Understanding viewer motivations informs niche and positioning decisions
   - E.g., "What job is my content doing for viewers? How is it different from competitors?"

**Progressive Disclosure Paths:**

**Path 1: Optimizing an Existing Video**
1. Start: `analytics-framework.md` (diagnose the issue)
2. Low CTR? → `thumbnail-tactics.md` + `title-tactics.md`
3. Low AVD? → `hook-tactics.md` + `retention-tactics.md`

**Path 2: Creating a New Video**
1. Start: `video-structure.md` (overall framework)
2. Load: `packaging-synergy.md` (thumbnail + title + hook)
3. Load type-specific: `content-structure-by-type.md`
4. Optimize: `youtube-seo-tactics.md` or `discovery-optimization.md`

**Path 3: Growing a Channel**
1. Start: `audience-growth.md` (growth fundamentals)
2. Load: `audience-psychology.md` (understand target viewer)
3. Load: `channel-strategy.md` (content planning)
4. Iterate: `testing-iteration.md` + `analytics-framework.md`

**Path 4: Learning the System**
1. Start: `algorithm-mechanics.md` + `platform-dynamics.md`
2. Then: `audience-psychology.md`
3. Then: All foundational references (thumbnails, titles, structure, growth)
4. Then: Advanced tactical references as needed
