# Workflow: Generate Brand-Aligned Landing Page Copy

**Purpose:** Create high-converting landing page copy that aligns with Vibeflow's brand strategy while applying evidence-based conversion principles.

**Prerequisites:** Access to brand strategy documents and landing page conversion guide.

---

## Phase 1: Load Brand Context

### Step 1.1: Load Core Brand Strategy

Read the following strategy documents to understand brand voice, positioning, and messaging:

```
/brand/strategy/brand-fundamentals/STRATEGY.md
/brand/strategy/positioning/STRATEGY.md
/brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md
/brand/strategy/messaging/STRATEGY.md
/brand/strategy/audience/STRATEGY.md
```

**Extract:**
- Core value proposition
- Brand pillars (5 key principles)
- Voice attributes (technically credible, intellectually provocative, ownership-focused, evidence-based, systems-builder)
- Target audience (Marketing Architects: ambitious 5-10% of strategists/agency owners)
- Strategic constraints (never say "easy", never lock in, never position AI as replacement, never target "all marketers", never prioritize volume over quality)

### Step 1.2: Load Landing Page Conversion Principles

Reference: `references/landing-page-guide.md` in this skill

**Key principles to apply:**
- Single focused conversion goal
- Benefits over features
- Clear, compelling CTAs
- Message match
- Above-the-fold priority
- Social proof authenticity
- Mobile optimization mindset

## Phase 2: Define Landing Page Goals

### Step 2.1: Clarify Conversion Objective

Identify the single primary action visitors should take:
- [ ] Sign up for early access
- [ ] Book a demo
- [ ] Download resource
- [ ] Start free trial
- [ ] Purchase product
- [ ] Join waitlist

### Step 2.2: Define Target Audience Segment

Within Marketing Architects, who specifically is this page for?
- Agency owners looking to scale
- Solo consultants seeking efficiency
- In-house marketing leaders building capabilities
- Technical marketers embracing AI

### Step 2.3: Identify Message Match Context

Where is traffic coming from?
- [ ] Paid ads (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- [ ] Organic search (specific keywords)
- [ ] Email campaigns
- [ ] Social media posts
- [ ] Referral links

**Ensure landing page headline matches ad/source copy.**

---

## Phase 3: Generate Landing Page Sections

### Step 3.1: Headline (Above the Fold)

**Formula:** [Problem solved] + [for whom] + [differentiator]

**Vibeflow-specific considerations:**
- Lead with transformation/capability, not convenience
- Use power verbs: "Build," "Own," "Architect," "Design," "Master"
- Avoid: "Easy," "Effortless," "Simple," "No technical skills required"
- Target the ambitious 5-10%, not "all marketers"

**Reference voice guidelines:**
- Tone: 90% straightforward, 85% serious, 70% respectful
- Active voice dominance
- Strong vocabulary without hedging
- Concrete language over abstractions

**Example framework:**
> Build [outcome] You Own—Not Rent [alternative competitor offers]

**Example:**
> Build Marketing Systems You Own—Not Rent Tools You'll Outgrow

### Step 3.2: Subheadline (Supporting Detail)

**Purpose:** Expand on headline promise with specific benefit.

**Structure:** [How it works] + [key benefit] + [for whom]

**Example:**
> Transform from overwhelmed tactician to Marketing Architect through owned AI infrastructure powered by Claude Code and the vibeflow framework.

### Step 3.3: Hero Section CTA

**CTA Copy Guidelines:**
- Descriptive of action (not generic)
- Benefits-oriented
- Creates urgency without pressure

**Vibeflow-appropriate CTAs:**
- ✅ "Start Building Your Infrastructure"
- ✅ "Become a Marketing Architect"
- ✅ "Own Your Strategic Advantage"
- ✅ "Access the Framework"
- ❌ "Get Started" (too generic)
- ❌ "Try It Free" (convenience language)
- ❌ "Sign Up" (too vague)

### Step 3.4: Value Proposition Section

**Structure:** 3-5 bullet points emphasizing **benefits over features**.

**Formula:** [Feature/capability] → [Benefit/outcome] → [Transformation]

**Vibeflow brand pillars to weave in:**
1. Capability Over Convenience
2. Own Your Stack, Own Your Destiny
3. Architect Systems, Don't Rent Automation
4. Enhance Humans, Don't Replace Them
5. Quality Through Craft, Not Volume Through Automation

**Example:**
- **Own your marketing infrastructure** → Never depend on SaaS vendors → Control your strategic destiny
- **Design proprietary workflows** → Build systems competitors can't replicate → Create defensible competitive moat
- **Scale expertise with AI** → Human judgment guides execution → Maintain craft quality at velocity

### Step 3.5: Social Proof Section

**Authentic testimonial requirements:**
- Real full name
- Job title and company
- Specific results/outcomes
- Professional photo if available
- Transformation story (before/after)

**Vibeflow-specific:**
- Feature William's story (Marketing Architect transformation)
- Use language like "working ON the business, not IN it"
- Emphasize ownership philosophy, not convenience
- Show complex systems built, not simple automations

**Structure:**
```
"[Transformation quote in their own words]"

[Specific result or outcome]

— [Full Name], [Job Title] at [Company]
```

### Step 3.6: Features/Benefits Grid

**Present in 2-column format:**
- Left: What it is (feature/capability)
- Right: What it enables (benefit/transformation)

**Always lead with benefits**, features support credibility.

**Example:**
| What You Get | What It Enables |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code-based infrastructure | Own your stack permanently—no subscription lock-in |
| Multi-model orchestration | Design workflows across Claude, GPT-4, Gemini without manual coordination |
| Version-controlled brand systems | Iterate strategy with full audit trail and rollback capability |

### Step 3.7: Trust Signals

**Include:**
- Customer logos (if available)
- Media mentions
- Credibility indicators (founded by X, backed by Y)
- Usage stats ("Used by X Marketing Architects")

**Vibeflow positioning:**
- Emphasize quality over quantity
- "Used by ambitious marketers" not "10,000+ users"
- Feature sophisticated practitioners, not mass market

### Step 3.8: Secondary CTA

Place before FAQ or at page end.

**Maintain consistency:** Use same CTA as hero section or reframe with additional context.

**Example progression:**
- Hero CTA: "Start Building Your Infrastructure"
- Secondary CTA: "Ready to Own Your Marketing Architecture?"

## Phase 4: Apply Conversion Optimization

### Step 4.1: Message Match Check

Verify landing page headline matches source:
- [ ] Headline echoes ad copy
- [ ] Keywords consistent
- [ ] Visual theme aligned
- [ ] Promise delivered

### Step 4.2: Conversion Principle Audit

Ensure page includes:
- [ ] Single focused conversion goal (one primary CTA)
- [ ] Benefits emphasized over features
- [ ] Clear, compelling CTA copy (descriptive, not generic)
- [ ] Remove navigation/distractions
- [ ] Authentic social proof with details
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design considerations
- [ ] Fast load time considerations (images optimized)

### Step 4.3: Voice Consistency Check

Verify Vibeflow voice maintained:
- [ ] Technically credible without jargon
- [ ] Intellectually provocative (challenges conventional thinking)
- [ ] Ownership-focused language ("own," "build," "architect")
- [ ] Evidence-based (specific outcomes, not vague promises)
- [ ] Systems-builder mindset (workflow, infrastructure, leverage)

### Step 4.4: Constraint Compliance

Ensure strategic constraints respected:
- [ ] Never uses "easy," "effortless," "simple"
- [ ] Never creates vendor lock-in
- [ ] Never positions AI as replacement
- [ ] Never targets "all marketers"
- [ ] Never prioritizes volume over quality

## Phase 5: Refine and Iterate

### Step 5.1: Simplify Copy

Landing page copy should be **scannable**:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bullet points for lists
- Subheadings to break content
- Bold key phrases

**Voice note:** Maintain Vibeflow's 75% casual, 85% serious tone—professional but conversational.

### Step 5.2: Strengthen Benefit Statements

For each feature mentioned, ask: **"So what?"**

Transform feature statements into benefit statements.

**Example transformation:**
- ❌ "Our tool has multi-model orchestration"
- ✅ "Run workflows across Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini without manual coordination—scaling your judgment, not replacing it"

### Step 5.3: Add Directional Cues

Suggest visual elements to guide eye:
- Arrows pointing to CTA
- Contrasting button colors
- White space highlighting key sections
- Strategic bold text

### Step 5.4: Progressive Disclosure Strategy

For complex pages, organize content:
- **Above fold:** Headline + value prop + CTA (fast-track for believers)
- **Below fold:** Education for skeptics (how it works, social proof, detailed benefits)
- **Bottom:** FAQ, secondary CTA, final trust signals

---

## Phase 6: Format for Delivery

### Step 6.1: Organize Sections

Present landing page copy in clear sections:

```
# Landing Page: [Title]

## Hero Section
- Headline
- Subheadline
- CTA copy

## Value Proposition
- 3-5 benefit bullets

## Social Proof
- Testimonial(s)

## Features/Benefits Grid
- Table format

## Trust Signals
- Logos, stats, credibility indicators

## Secondary CTA
- Reframed call to action

## FAQ (Optional)
- Common objections addressed
```

### Step 6.2: Include Implementation Notes

For each section, provide:
- **Copy:** Actual text
- **Design note:** Visual treatment suggestions
- **Voice rationale:** Why this aligns with brand strategy

**Example:**
```
## Headline
**Copy:** Build Marketing Systems You Own—Not Rent Tools You'll Outgrow

**Design note:** Large, bold typography. Consider split-screen layout with code terminal visual on right.

**Voice rationale:** "Build" vs "rent" reinforces Pillar 2 (Own Your Stack). Avoids "easy" language per constraint. Targets capability builders, not convenience seekers.
```

### Step 6.3: A/B Testing Recommendations

Suggest elements to test:
- Headline variations (benefit-focused vs transformation-focused)
- CTA copy (action-oriented vs outcome-oriented)
- Social proof placement (above vs below features)
- Form length (if lead gen)

---

## Output Deliverable

Provide complete landing page copy organized by sections with:
1. **Copy for each section** (ready to implement)
2. **Design notes** (visual treatment suggestions)
3. **Voice rationale** (brand alignment explanation)
4. **A/B testing recommendations** (elements to experiment with)
5. **Mobile considerations** (how copy adapts to smaller screens)

---
