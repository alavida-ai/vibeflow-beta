# Audience Assessment

Techniques for understanding who you're teaching and how they learn best.

## Why Assess First

The same concept requires completely different explanations for different audiences:
- A marketer needs business analogies
- A developer needs code examples
- A designer needs visual metaphors
- An executive needs ROI framing

**Assess before explaining—don't guess.**

## The Four Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Domain Knowledge - What They Already Know

**Key question:** "What existing mental models can I anchor to?"

#### Discovery Questions

**Direct approach:**
- "What's your background?" (role, industry, expertise)
- "Have you worked with [related concept] before?"
- "What systems/frameworks are you familiar with?"

**Indirect approach (from context):**
- Their role/title (Marketing Director → business thinking)
- Questions they ask (technical terms → technical background)
- How they describe problems (analogies they use)

#### Mapping Their Domain

| If they know... | You can anchor to... |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Marketing campaigns | Funnels, messaging hierarchies, brand guidelines |
| Software development | APIs, version control, modularity, abstractions |
| Design systems | Components, patterns, visual hierarchy |
| Project management | Workflows, dependencies, milestones |
| Finance/Accounting | Ledgers, reconciliation, audit trails |
| Sales | Pipelines, stages, qualification |

**Action:** Identify 2-3 concepts from their domain that map to what you're explaining.

### 2. Learning Style - How They Prefer to Learn

**Key question:** "Do they learn by seeing, doing, or understanding?"

#### The Three Primary Styles

**Visual/Spatial Learners:**
- Prefer diagrams, charts, spatial metaphors
- Say things like "I see what you mean", "Can you show me?"
- Benefit from: Folder structure diagrams, visual flows, spatial analogies

**Procedural/Kinesthetic Learners:**
- Prefer step-by-step, hands-on doing
- Say things like "Let me try", "Walk me through it"
- Benefit from: Guided walkthroughs, practice exercises, doing together

**Conceptual/Abstract Learners:**
- Prefer understanding WHY before HOW
- Say things like "What's the principle?", "Why does it work this way?"
- Benefit from: Philosophy explanations, underlying principles, big-picture first

#### Detection Signals

Listen for these phrases:

| Phrase | Likely Style | Response |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| "Show me" / "I need to see it" | Visual | Use diagrams, spatial metaphors |
| "Let me try" / "Can I do it?" | Procedural | Walk through together, hands-on |
| "Why does it work this way?" | Conceptual | Explain principles first |
| "What's the process?" | Procedural | Give step-by-step |
| "What's it like?" | Visual/Analogical | Use analogies, comparisons |

**Multi-modal approach:** When unsure, offer multiple modes and watch which resonates.

### 3. Immediate Need - Why They're Learning This

**Key question:** "Do they need to DO something now or BUILD understanding?"

#### Task-Oriented vs Knowledge-Oriented

**Task-Oriented (need to DO):**
- Signals: "I need to [specific action]", "How do I...?"
- Best approach: Procedural, direct, minimal theory
- Example: "I need to organize these customer interviews" → Show exactly where files go

**Knowledge-Oriented (need to UNDERSTAND):**
- Signals: "How does this work?", "What's the structure?"
- Best approach: Conceptual, build mental model, then application
- Example: "How does research organization work?" → Explain principles, then show

**Mixed (both):**
- Signals: "I need to [task] but I want to understand the system"
- Best approach: Quick win first (do the task), then zoom out to concept
- Example: Help them file their interviews, THEN explain the pattern

#### Depth Determination

| Immediate Need | Explanation Depth |
|---------------|------------------|
| "Quick answer to specific question" | Layer 1 only (one sentence) |
| "Complete specific task" | Layer 2 (brief + example) |
| "Understand system for ongoing use" | Layers 2-3 (detailed breakdown) |
| "Master concept deeply" | All layers + edge cases |

---

### 4. Confidence Level - How Comfortable They Are

**Key question:** "Are they confident or tentative?"

#### Confidence Indicators

**High Confidence:**
- Signals: Direct questions, willing to try, "I think I get it"
- Risks: May skip basics, miss nuances
- Approach: Move faster, offer depth, trust their judgement

**Low Confidence:**
- Signals: "Sorry if this is dumb", lots of clarifying questions, hesitant
- Risks: May be overwhelmed, afraid to try
- Approach: Normalize confusion, celebrate small wins, build safety

**Overconfidence (false confidence):**
- Signals: Agreeing quickly but questions reveal misunderstanding
- Risks: Will make mistakes based on wrong mental model
- Approach: Gently check understanding, reveal gaps through questions

## Rapid Assessment Framework

**When you don't have time for deep assessment, use these quick heuristics:**

### By Role/Title

| Role | Likely Profile |
|------|---------------|
| Marketer | Business analogies, campaign examples, ROI-focused |
| Developer | Code examples, technical precision, "how it works" |
| Designer | Visual metaphors, component thinking, aesthetics |
| Product Manager | User stories, value framing, trade-offs |
| Executive | High-level, business impact, time-constrained |
| Researcher | Evidence-based, methodology-focused, detail-oriented |

### By Question Type

| Question Pattern | What It Reveals |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "How do I...?" | Task-oriented, procedural learner |
| "What is...?" | Conceptual learner, building mental model |
| "Where does...?" | Spatial learner, structure-focused |
| "Why does...?" | Principle-focused, needs rationale |
| "Can you show me...?" | Visual learner, wants examples |

### By Communication Style

| If they... | Likely approach |
|-----------|----------------|
| Use technical jargon | Can handle technical explanations |
| Use casual language | Prefer accessible, simple explanations |
| Ask lots of questions | Want depth, comfortable engaging |
| Stay quiet | May be overwhelmed OR processing deeply |

## Assessment in Action

### Example 1: Marketing Director

**Signals observed:**
- Role: Marketing Director
- Question: "How does this system help me organize campaign research?"
- Language: Non-technical, business-focused

**Assessment:**
- Domain: Marketing (campaigns, brand guidelines)
- Learning style: Likely task-oriented (specific need)
- Immediate need: Organize campaign research (DO something)
- Confidence: Moderate (asking how it helps them specifically)

**Response approach:**
- Use marketing analogies
- Show exactly where campaign research goes
- Frame around their workflow (campaigns)
- Keep technical details minimal

---

### Example 2: Junior Developer

**Signals observed:**
- Role: Junior Developer
- Question: "I'm new to this system—can you explain how the folder structure works?"
- Language: "I'm new", seeking comprehensive understanding

**Assessment:**
- Domain: Technical (understands code, file systems)
- Learning style: Conceptual (wants to understand the "how")
- Immediate need: Build mental model for ongoing use
- Confidence: Low (explicitly says "I'm new")

**Response approach:**
- Can use technical analogies (version control, modules)
- Explain underlying principles
- Build confidence with "this is like concepts you know"
- Offer to walk through together

---

## Dynamic Re-Assessment

**Assessment isn't one-time—adjust as you learn more.**

### Mid-Explanation Signals to Watch

**They're getting it:**
- Nodding, "oh I see", building on your explanation
- Action: Can go deeper or faster

**They're confused:**
- Silence, "wait", furrowed brow
- Action: Simplify, try different method

**They're bored:**
- Impatient, "yeah yeah", trying to skip ahead
- Action: Move faster, offer depth

**They're overwhelmed:**
- Lots of questions, backtracking, "I'm lost"
- Action: Slow down, break into smaller pieces

## Assessment Checklist

Before explaining, quickly determine:

- [ ] What domain are they from? (marketing, tech, design, etc.)
- [ ] What concepts from their domain can I anchor to?
- [ ] Do they prefer visual, procedural, or conceptual explanations?
- [ ] Do they need to DO something now or BUILD understanding?
- [ ] How confident/comfortable are they?
- [ ] What's the minimum depth needed for their immediate need?

**The better your assessment, the more effective your explanation.**
