# Adaptation Patterns

Real-time adjustment strategies when explanations aren't landing.

## When to Adapt

**Constant monitoring required:** Teaching is dynamic—watch signals and adjust continuously.

**Key principle:** If current approach isn't working after 2-3 attempts, switch methods completely.

## The Five Adaptation Strategies

### 1. Method Switching - Change How You're Explaining

**When:** Current method clearly isn't working (confusion signals persist)

**How to switch:**

| From | To | Example Transition |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| Conceptual | Analogy | "Let me give you a concrete comparison..." |
| Analogy | Example | "Here's how this works in practice..." |
| Example | Procedural | "Let me walk you through the steps..." |
| Procedural | Visual | "Let me show you the structure..." |
| Abstract | Concrete | "Forget the theory—here's what you'd actually do..." |

**Transition phrases:**
- "Let me try a different approach..."
- "Here's another way to think about it..."
- "Let me show you instead of telling you..."

**Example:**
```
[Conceptual explanation not landing]
"Let me try a different way. Instead of the philosophy, 
here's a concrete example from your work: [specific scenario]..."
```

### 2. Depth Adjustment - Change How Much Detail

**When:** They're overwhelmed OR bored/impatient

**Too much depth (overwhelm signals):**

**Response:** Climb down the complexity ladder
- From L3 → L2 or L1
- Remove technical details
- Focus on "what you need to know right now"

**Example:**
```
"Actually, you don't need all that detail yet. Here's the simple version:
[one sentence]. Let's just work with that for now."
```

**Too little depth (impatience/boredom signals):**

**Response:** Climb up the complexity ladder
- From L1 → L2 or L3
- Add nuance and edge cases
- Explain underlying principles

**Example:**
```
"You seem to have the basics. Let me go deeper into why this works this way..."
```

---

### 3. Anchor Replacement - Change the Reference Point

**When:** Your analogy/comparison isn't resonating

**How to find new anchor:**
1. Ask about their background: "What's your experience with...?"
2. Listen for what concepts they reference
3. Find parallel in their domain
4. Rebuild explanation using new anchor

**Example:**
```
[Marketing analogy not working]
"Actually, what's your background—are you more technical?"
"Oh, you code? Okay, think of it like version control branches..."
[Rebuilt with development anchor]
```

---

### 4. Pace Adjustment - Change How Fast You're Going

**When:** Moving too fast OR too slow for their processing speed

**Too fast (confusion, overwhelm):**

**Signals:** "Wait", lots of questions, lost look

**Response:**
- Slow down significantly
- Pause after each point
- Check understanding before continuing
- Break into smaller pieces

**Example:**
```
"Let me slow down—I'm throwing too much at you. 
Let's just focus on [one thing]. [Explain]. Got that part?
[Wait for confirmation]. Okay, now let's add..."
```

**Too slow (impatience, boredom):**

**Signals:** "Yeah yeah", finishing your sentences, "I get it"

**Response:**
- Speed up
- Skip basics
- Jump to application
- Trust their capability

**Example:**
```
"You're getting this quickly. Let me skip ahead to the advanced part..."
```

### 5. Interaction Mode - Change Level of Engagement

**When:** Current level of interaction isn't matching their needs

**From passive to active:**

**When:** They're disengaged, drifting

**How:**
- Ask questions instead of telling
- Have them try something
- Make it hands-on

**Example:**
```
[They're zoning out during explanation]
"Actually, let's try this together. Open [file] and let's walk through it..."
```

**From active to passive:**

**When:** They just want the answer, task-focused

**How:**
- Stop asking questions
- Give direct answer
- Offer depth later if they want

**Example:**
```
"Okay, quick answer: Do [X]. Want to understand why, or keep moving?"
```

## Adaptation Decision Matrix

| Signal | Likely Issue | Adaptation Strategy |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Confusion after 2+ explanations | Wrong method | Method switching |
| "This is a lot" | Too much depth | Depth down (L3→L1) |
| "Yeah, I know" | Too little depth | Depth up (L1→L3) |
| Analogy not clicking | Wrong anchor | Anchor replacement |
| "Wait, what?" | Too fast | Slow pace |
| Impatient, skipping ahead | Too slow | Speed up |
| Disengaged | Too passive | Make it active |
| "Just tell me" | Too active | Give direct answer |

## Graceful Recovery Phrases

**When switching methods:**
- "Let me try explaining this differently..."
- "Here's another way to look at it..."
- "Actually, a better example would be..."

**When simplifying:**
- "Let me break this down more..."
- "Here's the simpler version..."
- "You don't need all that detail—here's what matters..."

**When going deeper:**
- "Since you've got the basics, let's dive deeper..."
- "Want to see how this really works?"
- "Here's the full picture..."

**When slowing down:**
- "Let me slow down—this is important..."
- "I'm going too fast. Let's take this step by step..."

**When speeding up:**
- "You're getting this—let me move faster..."
- "I'll skip the basics since you have those..."

**When correcting misunderstanding:**
- "I see where that might seem similar..."
- "That's a logical way to think about it, but..."
- "Close—here's the key difference..."

## Multi-Level Adaptation

**Sometimes you need to adapt multiple dimensions:**

**Example: Overwhelmed visual learner**
- Depth adjustment: L3 → L1 (simpler)
- Method switching: Conceptual → Visual (diagram)
- Pace adjustment: Slow down
- Check: "Is this clearer?"

**Example: Bored technical audience**
- Depth adjustment: L1 → L3 (more complexity)
- Anchor replacement: Business → Technical analogies
- Pace adjustment: Speed up
- Check: "Want even more detail?"

---

## When Adaptation Isn't Working

**If you've tried 3+ different approaches and they're still confused:**

1. **Check prerequisites:**
   - "Are you familiar with [fundamental concept]?"
   - They might be missing foundation

2. **Offer different timing:**
   - "Want to come back to this after we cover [prerequisite]?"

3. **Offer alternative path:**
   - "This might make more sense once you've tried [related task]"

4. **Be honest:**
   - "This is a tricky concept. Let's try it hands-on and see if it clicks"

5. **Defer:**
   - "Let's table this for now and circle back"

**Don't:** Keep beating the same explanation—diminishing returns.

## Adaptation Checklist

Before continuing with a new approach, verify:

- [ ] I've identified which signal I'm seeing
- [ ] I know what's not working about current approach
- [ ] I've chosen specific adaptation strategy
- [ ] I've transitioned gracefully (not abruptly)
- [ ] I'm watching for signals about new approach
- [ ] I'm prepared to adapt again if needed

## Real-Time Adaptation Examples

### Example 1: Concept not landing

**Attempt 1 (Conceptual):** "Progressive disclosure manages cognitive load by..."
**Signal:** Confusion
**Adaptation:** Switch to analogy
**Attempt 2:** "It's like reading a book—you don't read cover-to-cover to find one chapter"
**Signal:** "Oh! I get it"
**Result:** Success

---

### Example 2: Wrong depth

**Attempt 1 (L3):** "The system uses UPPERCASE.md as entry points with progressive..."
**Signal:** "This is a lot"
**Adaptation:** Simplify to L1
**Attempt 2:** "Think of UPPERCASE files as tables of contents"
**Signal:** "Okay, that makes sense"
**Adaptation:** Check if ready for more
**Question:** "Want to see how they work, or is that enough for now?"

---

### Example 3: Wrong pace

**Attempt 1 (Slow):** "First, you open the folder. Then, you look for..."
**Signal:** "Yeah yeah, I know"
**Adaptation:** Speed up, trust them
**Attempt 2:** "You got it. Once you're in there, just [quick instruction]"
**Signal:** Confidence, action
**Result:** Success

## Pattern: The Adaptation Loop

```
Deliver explanation
    ↓
Watch signals (1-2 seconds)
    ↓
Signal received?
    ├─ Success → Build forward
    ├─ Confusion → Adapt method/depth/pace
    ├─ Ready for more → Go deeper
    └─ Misunderstanding → Correct model
    ↓
Deliver adapted explanation
    ↓
Watch signals again
    ↓
Repeat until understanding achieved
```

**Key:** This loop happens continuously, often multiple times per minute.
