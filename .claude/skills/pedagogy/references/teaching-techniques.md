# Teaching Techniques

Advanced pedagogical patterns for exceptional explanation.

## The Seven Core Techniques

### 1. The Anchor Technique (Known → Unknown)

**Principle:** Start from what they already know, bridge to what they don't.

**Steps:**
1. Identify concept they're familiar with
2. Show how new concept is similar
3. Highlight key differences
4. Practice applying the pattern

**Example:**
```
Them: "What's progressive disclosure?"
You: "You know how in marketing you have messaging hierarchies? 
      High-level message first, supporting details below? 
      Progressive disclosure works the same way with information—
      overview first, details when needed. 
      Difference: It's dynamic, not just visual hierarchy."
```

**Why it works:** New learning builds on existing neural pathways.

### 2. The Discovery Question Pattern (Socratic Method)

**Principle:** Guide them to discover the answer rather than telling them.

**Question sequence:**
1. **Activate prior knowledge:** "When you [familiar activity], what do you do?"
2. **Guide analysis:** "What are the stages of that?"
3. **Draw parallel:** "How might that apply to [new concept]?"
4. **Confirm discovery:** "Exactly! See how it's the same pattern?"

**Example:**
```
Them: "Why are there three folders in research domains?"
You: "When you run a marketing campaign, what stages do you go through?"
Them: "Planning, execution, measurement..."
You: "Right. What if you were doing research instead?"
Them: "Collecting data... analyzing it... I guess reporting results?"
You: "Exactly! That's why three folders: data (collect), date-stamped (analyze), exports (report)."
```

**Benefits:** Deeper retention, builds confidence, reveals understanding gaps.

### 3. The Reflection Loop

**Principle:** Pause after explaining to gauge and deepen understanding.

**The loop:**
1. **Explain** concept
2. **Pause** (give them thinking time)
3. **Ask reflection question:** "What part of that landed for you?" or "What's still fuzzy?"
4. **Adjust** based on response
5. **Repeat** until clear

**Reflection questions:**
- "What makes sense so far?"
- "What part is still unclear?"
- "How would you explain this to a colleague?"
- "Where would this apply in your work?"

**Why it works:** Metacognition—thinking about thinking—deepens learning.

### 4. The Failure Forward Technique

**Principle:** Show common mistakes BEFORE they make them.

**Approach:**
1. Introduce concept
2. "Most people's first instinct is to [common mistake]"
3. "But here's why that breaks down..."
4. Show the correct approach
5. Explain why correct approach works

**Example:**
```
"When people first organize research, they usually put everything in one big folder.
Makes sense—it's simple! But here's what happens:
- Can't find anything after a few months
- Don't know which analysis is most recent
- Can't compare how things changed

That's why we use date-stamped folders—keeps history organized."
```

**Benefits:** Prevents mistakes, validates their intuition, shows you understand their perspective.

### 5. The Pattern Recognition Build

**Principle:** Show pattern once, then help them identify it in new contexts.

**Steps:**
1. **Teach pattern explicitly** in one context
2. **Show same pattern** in different context
3. **Ask them to identify pattern** in third context
4. **Generalize the principle**

**Example:**
```
Context 1: "STRATEGY.md is an entry point—guides you to specific files"
Context 2: "RESEARCH.md works the same way—entry point for research domain"
Question: "If you saw SKILL.md, what would you expect it to do?"
Them: "Entry point for... a skill?"
You: "Exactly! See the pattern? UPPERCASE.md files are always entry points."
```

**Why it works:** Pattern recognition enables transfer to new situations.

### 6. The Complexity Ladder

**Principle:** Layer information progressively—let them choose how high to climb.

**The ladder:**
1. **One-sentence summary** (L1)
2. **Brief explanation + example** (L2)
3. **Detailed breakdown** (L3)
4. **Edge cases and nuances** (L4)

**Delivery:**
- Give L1, pause
- Watch for signals (confusion, interest, ready-for-more)
- Offer next level: "Want me to go deeper?"
- Continue based on their response

**Example:**
```
L1: "Progressive disclosure means loading info when needed, not all at once."
[Pause, watch signals]
L2: "Like reading a book—you don't read cover-to-cover to find one chapter. 
     Entry point files (STRATEGY.md) guide you to what you need."
[Check understanding]
L3: "Here's how it works: Start with STRATEGY.md, see the navigation, 
     load only the specific files for your task. Saves cognitive load."
[If they're ready]
L4: "This enables scalability—system can grow indefinitely without overwhelming users,
     because you never load everything at once..."
```

**Benefits:** Prevents overwhelm, respects their time, adapts to their needs.

### 7. The "What Would You Do?" Method

**Principle:** Present scenario, ask what they'd do, guide their thinking.

**Structure:**
1. **Present realistic scenario**
2. **Ask what they would do**
3. **Listen to their approach**
4. **Guide toward correct solution** (don't just correct)
5. **Reinforce their good instincts**

**Example:**
```
You: "You just finished 10 customer interviews. You have transcripts and notes. 
      What would you do with them?"
Them: "Probably put them in a folder somewhere..."
You: "Good instinct—organization is key. Where would that folder live?"
Them: "Maybe... research?"
You: "Yes! In /research/. What would you call the folder?"
Them: "customer-interviews?"
You: "Perfect—clear and descriptive. Now, would these be raw data or analysis?"
Them: "Raw data—just the transcripts."
You: "Exactly. So they'd go in /research/customer-interviews/data/. 
      You're thinking like the system already!"
```

**Benefits:** Active learning, builds confidence, reveals their intuition.

## Combining Techniques

**Most effective teaching uses multiple techniques:**

**Example: Teaching research organization**

1. **Anchor:** "You organize marketing campaigns—this is similar"
2. **Discovery:** "What stages would research have?"
3. **Pattern Recognition:** "See how entry points work the same everywhere?"
4. **Complexity Ladder:** Start simple, add depth based on signals
5. **Reflection Loop:** "What makes sense? What's unclear?"

## Advanced Tips

### Creating Psychological Safety

**Make confusion normal:**
- "This trips everyone up initially"
- "Great question—shows deep thinking"
- "I struggled with this too when learning"

**Validate their approach:**
- "Your instinct is right—here's why..."
- "That's a logical way to think about it"
- "You're on the right track"

### Building Momentum

**Celebrate small wins:**
- "You got it! See how quick that clicked?"
- "Exactly right"
- "Perfect—you're thinking like the system"

**Connect successes:**
- "You just learned X, now Y will be easy because..."
- "Same pattern you used before"

### Promoting Independence

**Teach the method, not just the answer:**
- "Here's how I'd figure that out..."
- "Let me show you where to look..."
- "Now YOU try finding..."

**Progressive release:**
1. I do, you watch
2. We do together
3. You do, I watch
4. You do independently

## Technique Pitfalls to Avoid

### Anchor Technique
- ❌ Using anchors from unfamiliar domains
- ❌ Not explaining where metaphor breaks down
- ✅ Verify they know the anchor concept first

### Discovery Questions
- ❌ Getting frustrated if they don't discover it
- ❌ Using when time-pressured
- ✅ Guide gently if they're struggling

### Reflection Loop
- ❌ Asking "Does that make sense?" (they'll say yes)
- ❌ Moving on without genuine check
- ✅ Ask questions that reveal understanding

### Failure Forward
- ❌ Making them feel dumb for intuitive mistake
- ❌ Just listing what NOT to do
- ✅ Validate their instinct, explain why different approach works

### Pattern Recognition
- ❌ Assuming they see pattern without asking
- ❌ Moving too fast to new contexts
- ✅ Explicitly name the pattern

### Complexity Ladder
- ❌ Dumping all levels at once
- ❌ Staying at L1 when they're ready for more
- ✅ Watch signals, adapt

### "What Would You Do?"
- ❌ Correcting harshly when wrong
- ❌ Not giving enough thinking time
- ✅ Guide their thinking, celebrate good instincts
