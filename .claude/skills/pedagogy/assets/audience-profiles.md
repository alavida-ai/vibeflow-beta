# Audience Profiles

Common audience types and how to teach them effectively.

## Marketer Profile

**Domain knowledge:** Campaigns, funnels, messaging, brand guidelines, ROI, customer journeys

**Learning preferences:**
- Business analogies and outcomes
- "What does this enable?" framing
- Real campaign examples
- Visual storytelling

**Best analogies:**
- File structure → Brand guidelines binder
- Progressive disclosure → Messaging hierarchy
- Temporal research → Campaign performance tracking over time
- Audit trails → Showing your work to stakeholders

**Preferred methods:**
- Analogy (business)
- Example (campaigns)
- Visual (customer journeys, funnels)

**Avoid:**
- Technical jargon ("context management", "file system patterns")
- Code examples
- Deep technical details
- "Because the architecture..."

**Example explanation:**
"Think of /strategy/ like your brand guidelines binder—everything in there is polished and ready to show clients. The /research/ folder is where you do the messy work, like analyzing survey data before turning it into a campaign brief."

## Developer Profile

**Domain knowledge:** Code, APIs, version control, modules, abstractions, algorithms

**Learning preferences:**
- Conceptual understanding (WHY it works)
- Technical precision
- Code examples
- System architecture

**Best analogies:**
- Progressive disclosure → Lazy loading / on-demand imports
- Entry points → Module exports / API endpoints
- Temporal folders → Git branches / version history
- Three-folder pattern → Input/Process/Output pipeline

**Preferred methods:**
- Conceptual (principles first)
- Example (code/technical)
- Visual (architecture diagrams)

**Embrace:**
- Technical terminology
- Precision and edge cases
- "How does this scale?"
- Implementation details

**Example explanation:**
"Think of STRATEGY.md as an index file—it doesn't contain everything, it points to specific modules. Progressive disclosure means you load dependencies when needed, not upfront. Like lazy loading but for information architecture."

---

## Designer Profile

**Domain knowledge:** Design systems, components, visual hierarchy, user flows, aesthetics

**Learning preferences:**
- Visual representations
- Component thinking
- User experience framing
- Aesthetic patterns

**Best analogies:**
- Strategy files → Design system documentation
- Progressive disclosure → Progressive enhancement
- File structure → Component library organization
- Visual hierarchy → Information hierarchy

**Preferred methods:**
- Visual (diagrams, spatial)
- Analogy (design concepts)
- Example (show, don't tell)

**Avoid:**
- Text-heavy explanations
- Purely abstract concepts without visuals
- Technical implementation details

**Example explanation:**
"The folder structure works like a design system. STRATEGY.md is your component index—you don't load every component, you navigate to what you need. Entry points create clear navigation hierarchy, like good IA in a product."

---

## Product Manager Profile

**Domain knowledge:** User stories, features, roadmaps, trade-offs, stakeholder management

**Learning preferences:**
- Value framing ("What problem does this solve?")
- User perspective
- Trade-off thinking
- Practical application

**Best analogies:**
- File organization → Feature organization
- Progressive disclosure → Phased rollout
- Temporal research → A/B test results over time
- Audit trails → Decision documentation

**Preferred methods:**
- Example (user stories)
- Conceptual (value/trade-offs)
- Procedural (workflows)

**Frame everything as:**
- User needs
- Business value
- Trade-offs and decisions
- "This enables..."

**Example explanation:**
"Progressive disclosure solves the information overwhelm problem—like how you don't show users every feature at once. Users (in this case, you) get high-level navigation first, drill into details when needed. Scales without overwhelming."

---

## Executive Profile

**Domain knowledge:** Business strategy, ROI, competitive advantage, operational efficiency

**Learning preferences:**
- High-level, strategic
- Time-efficient
- Bottom-line focused
- "So what?" clarity

**Best analogies:**
- System architecture → Organizational structure
- Progressive disclosure → Need-to-know information
- Temporal research → Market trend tracking
- Audit trails → Accountability and governance

**Preferred methods:**
- Conceptual (high-level)
- Example (business outcomes)
- Time-constrained (< 2 minutes)

**Lead with:**
- Business impact
- Efficiency gains
- Risk mitigation
- Strategic advantage

**Avoid:**
- Technical details
- Long explanations
- "How it works" without "why it matters"

**Example explanation:**
"This system prevents the chaos of scattered marketing assets. Everything's organized, trackable, and auditable. Your team can scale content production without losing brand consistency. ROI: Less time searching, more time creating."

---

## Researcher Profile

**Domain knowledge:** Methodology, data collection, analysis, evidence, rigor

**Learning preferences:**
- Evidence-based explanations
- Methodology transparency
- "How do you know?" thinking
- Systematic approaches

**Best analogies:**
- File structure → Research protocol
- Temporal folders → Longitudinal studies
- Audit trails → Research provenance
- Three-folder pattern → Research workflow

**Preferred methods:**
- Conceptual (methodology)
- Procedural (systematic)
- Evidence/examples (show the research)

**Value:**
- Rigor and structure
- Reproducibility
- Transparency
- Evidence chains

**Example explanation:**
"The three-folder pattern mirrors research workflow: data collection (/data/), analysis (date-stamped folders), and publication (/exports/). Date-stamping preserves temporal context—like longitudinal studies, you can track how findings evolve. Audit trails create research provenance."

---

## Beginner (Any Domain) Profile

**Domain knowledge:** Varies, but assume minimal with THIS system

**Learning preferences:**
- Simple, clear explanations
- Step-by-step guidance
- Hands-on practice
- Safety to make mistakes

**Best analogies:**
- Everyday concepts (filing cabinets, bookshelves, recipes)
- Familiar technology (folders on computer, Google Docs)

**Preferred methods:**
- Analogy (simple, familiar)
- Procedural (hold their hand)
- Example (show exactly what to do)
- Lots of encouragement

**Critical:**
- Make mistakes safe
- Celebrate small wins
- Check understanding frequently
- Don't assume ANY prior knowledge

**Avoid:**
- Domain-specific jargon (even "their" domain)
- Multiple concepts at once
- Assuming they'll "figure it out"

**Example explanation:**
"Think of this like organizing files on your computer. /strategy/ is like your 'Important Documents' folder—polished stuff. /research/ is like your 'Work In Progress' folder—messy notes and drafts. Easy way to remember: strategy = final, research = working."

## Cross-Domain Translation Matrix

| Concept | Marketer | Developer | Designer | Product Manager |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Progressive disclosure | Messaging hierarchy | Lazy loading | Progressive enhancement | Phased feature rollout |
| Entry points | Campaign brief TOC | Module exports | Component index | Feature overview |
| Temporal research | Campaign performance over time | Version history | Design iteration tracking | A/B test results |
| Audit trails | Stakeholder accountability | Commit history | Design decisions doc | Decision log |
| Three-folder pattern | Brief → Execution → Report | Input → Process → Output | Assets → Prototypes → Final | Research → Build → Launch |

## Rapid Audience Assessment

**Listen for these phrases to quickly identify type:**

| Phrase | Likely Profile |
|--------|---------------|
| "What's the ROI?" | Executive |
| "How does it scale?" | Developer |
| "What's the user experience?" | Designer / Product Manager |
| "Can you show me an example?" | Marketer / Beginner |
| "What's the methodology?" | Researcher |
| "What problem does this solve?" | Product Manager |
| "I'm new to this" | Beginner |

---

## Multi-Profile Audiences

**When teaching groups with mixed profiles:**

1. **Start universal:** Use everyday analogies everyone understands
2. **Offer examples from each domain:** "For marketers, think X. For developers, think Y."
3. **Let them choose depth:** "Want high-level or detailed walkthrough?"
4. **Acknowledge diversity:** "This might click differently depending on your background"

---

## Profile Adaptation Mid-Explanation

**If your initial profile assessment was wrong:**

**Signals:**
- Analogy doesn't land
- They use different terminology than expected
- Confusion despite "appropriate" method

**Response:**
"Actually, what's your background?" 
[Listen]
"Ah! Let me reframe this for [their actual domain]..."

---

## Using Profiles Effectively

**Don't stereotype:** Profiles are starting points, not boxes
**Watch signals:** Adapt if individual deviates from profile
**Ask when unsure:** "What's your background?" reveals profile quickly
**Combine approaches:** Many people span multiple profiles

**The goal: Meet them where THEY are, not where you assume they are.**
