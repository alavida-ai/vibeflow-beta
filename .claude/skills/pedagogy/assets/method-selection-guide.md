# Method Selection Guide

Decision framework for choosing the most effective explanation method.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START: What type of concept are you explaining?
    │
    ├─ Abstract/Unfamiliar → Use ANALOGY
    │   └─ Map to familiar concept in their domain
    │
    ├─ Process/Workflow → Use PROCEDURAL
    │   └─ Step-by-step walkthrough
    │
    ├─ Structure/System → Use VISUAL/SPATIAL
    │   └─ Diagrams, spatial metaphors
    │
    ├─ Principle/Theory → Use CONCEPTUAL
    │   └─ Explain why it works this way
    │
    └─ Correcting confusion → Use CONTRAST
        └─ Show what it's NOT
```

## By Concept Type

| Concept Type | Primary Method | Secondary Method | Example |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Abstract pattern | Analogy | Example | "Progressive disclosure" |
| Sequential process | Procedural | Visual | "Creating research domain" |
| System architecture | Visual/Spatial | Conceptual | "Folder structure" |
| Underlying principle | Conceptual | Analogy | "Why temporal research?" |
| Distinguishing A from B | Contrast | Analogy | "Skills vs commands" |
| Tool/technique usage | Procedural | Example | "Using footnotes" |
| Relationship between parts | Visual/Spatial | Example | "How strategy links to research" |

---

## By Audience Type

| Audience | Preferred Methods | Avoid | Example Approach |
|----------|------------------|-------|------------------|
| Marketers | Analogy (business), Example | Technical conceptual | "Like brand guidelines..." |
| Developers | Conceptual, Example (code) | Oversimplified | "Think of it like modules..." |
| Designers | Visual, Analogy (design) | Text-heavy | "Like component libraries..." |
| Product Managers | Example (user stories), Conceptual | Too abstract | "When users need to..." |
| Executives | Conceptual (high-level), Example (ROI) | Detailed procedural | "This enables..." |
| Beginners (any domain) | Analogy, Procedural | Conceptual depth | "Let's do it together..." |

---

## By Learning Objective

| Goal | Best Method | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Quick comprehension | Analogy → Example | Fast mental model building |
| Do specific task | Procedural | Immediate actionability |
| Build transferable understanding | Conceptual → Pattern Recognition | Enables application to new situations |
| Correct misunderstanding | Contrast → Correct Example | Clarifies boundaries |
| Deep mastery | Discovery → Conceptual → Procedural | Internalizes through active learning |
| Remember long-term | Analogy → Example → Practice | Multiple encoding paths |

---

## By Time Available

| Time | Method Sequence | Depth |
|------|----------------|-------|
| < 1 minute | Example only | L1 |
| 1-3 minutes | Analogy → Example | L1-L2 |
| 3-5 minutes | Analogy → Example → Procedural | L2 |
| 5-10 minutes | Conceptual → Analogy → Example | L2-L3 |
| 10+ minutes | Discovery → Conceptual → Procedural | L3-L4 |

---

## Combination Strategies

### Recommended Method Combinations

**For abstract concepts:**
1. Analogy (build mental model)
2. Example (make concrete)
3. Contrast (clarify boundaries)

**For processes:**
1. Visual (show structure)
2. Procedural (walk through steps)
3. Example (apply to real case)

**For deep understanding:**
1. Discovery (guide to answer)
2. Conceptual (explain principles)
3. Example (demonstrate application)
4. Procedural (practice it)

**For quick tasks:**
1. Example (show outcome)
2. Procedural (how to do it)
3. Offer depth if wanted

## Method Effectiveness Matrix

| Method | Speed | Depth | Retention | Best For |
|--------|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Analogy | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Quick understanding |
| Example | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | Concrete illustration |
| Visual | ⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Structure/systems |
| Discovery | ⚡ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Deep mastery |
| Procedural | ⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Immediate tasks |
| Conceptual | ⚡ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Transferable knowledge |
| Contrast | ⚡⚡ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | Clarifying confusion |

---

## Adaptive Selection

**Start with primary method, adapt based on signals:**

```
Choose initial method (based on concept/audience)
    ↓
Deliver explanation
    ↓
Watch signals
    ↓
    ├─ Success → Continue
    ├─ Confusion → Try secondary method
    ├─ Partial understanding → Add another method
    └─ Misunderstanding → Use contrast
```

## Context-Specific Guidance

### When They're Task-Focused

**Best:** Procedural → Example
**Avoid:** Long conceptual explanations
**Why:** They need to do something NOW

---

### When They're Building Mental Models

**Best:** Conceptual → Analogy → Visual
**Avoid:** Just procedural without context
**Why:** Need to understand system, not just one task

---

### When They're Confused

**Best:** Switch method completely
- Was using conceptual? → Try analogy
- Was using analogy? → Try example
- Was using example? → Try procedural

---

### When correcting Misunderstanding

**Best:** Contrast → Correct Example → Conceptual
1. Show what it's NOT
2. Show what it IS
3. Explain WHY

---

## Selection Checklist

Before choosing method, ask:

- [ ] What type of concept is this? (abstract, process, structure, principle)
- [ ] Who is the audience? (domain, learning style)
- [ ] What do they need? (do task vs understand system)
- [ ] How much time do we have?
- [ ] What signal did I just observe? (confusion, ready, etc.)
- [ ] Is this working? (if not, what's my backup method?)

## Examples of Method Selection

### Scenario 1: Explaining "Progressive Disclosure" to Marketer

**Analysis:**
- Concept: Abstract pattern
- Audience: Marketer (business analogies)
- Need: Build understanding (not immediate task)
- Time: 3-5 minutes

**Method Selection:**
1. **Analogy** - "Like messaging hierarchy—high-level first"
2. **Example** - "STRATEGY.md is entry point, not dumping all content"
3. **Conceptual** - "Enables scalability, reduces cognitive load"

---

### Scenario 2: "How do I organize these customer interviews?" (Task-focused researcher)

**Analysis:**
- Concept: Process
- Audience: Researcher (evidence-focused)
- Need: Do specific task NOW
- Time: 1-2 minutes

**Method Selection:**
1. **Procedural** - "Put them in /research/customer-insight/data/"
2. **Example** - "Like this: /research/customer-insight/data/interview-01.md"
3. **Offer depth** - "Want to understand the full system or just get this done?"

---

### Scenario 3: Developer asking "How does the system architecture work?"

**Analysis:**
- Concept: System structure
- Audience: Developer (technical, conceptual)
- Need: Understand for ongoing use
- Time: 5-10 minutes

**Method Selection:**
1. **Conceptual** - "Built on progressive disclosure principle"
2. **Visual** - [Show folder tree diagram]
3. **Analogy (technical)** - "Entry points are like module exports"
4. **Example** - "Here's how you'd navigate to find X"
