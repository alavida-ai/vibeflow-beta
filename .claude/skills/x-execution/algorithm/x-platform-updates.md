## Link Handling Policy Evolution

### The Shift (October 2025)

**Previous Policy (Until September 2025):**
```
External link in post → Heavy algorithmic penalty
Result: Link posts received minimal distribution
Philosophy: Keep users on X platform
```

**New Approach (Testing October 2025):**
```
External link + quality content → Normal distribution
External link + low-quality caption → Limited distribution
Result: Link viability depends on post quality
Philosophy: User choice with in-app browser
```

### Implementation

**In-app Browser:**
- Users can view linked content within X
- Don't have to leave platform to see link destination
- Reduces friction while supporting external content

**Distribution Logic:**
- Link post ranking = post quality + link relevance
- Caption quality matters as much as link
- Image preview quality affects visibility
- Domain reputation still factors in

### Best Practice Evolution

**Before (High-penalty links):**
```
Check out this resource: [URL]
```
Result: Minimal reach

**After (Quality links):**
```
We discovered 3 surprising patterns in [topic].
Here's the data: [compelling visual]

Full analysis: [URL]
```
Result: Normal reach if post is strong

**Principle:**
> "The post should stand alone as great content—write a solid caption." - Nikita Beer, X Head of Product
