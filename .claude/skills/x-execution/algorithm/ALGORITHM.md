# X (Twitter) Algorithm Intelligence

## Overview

This folder contains actionable intelligence about X's algorithm—how it works, what it prioritizes, and how to optimize content for maximum reach and engagement. All content is synthesized from official X announcements, platform documentation, and verified industry research.

## Key Context: Algorithmic Transition (September-December 2025)

X is undergoing the most significant algorithmic transformation in its history:

**Timeline:**
- **September 2025:** Announcement of Grok AI-powered system replacing all heuristics
- **October 2025:** New link handling, account transparency, continued testing
- **November-December 2025:** Transition to "purely AI" algorithm complete

**What This Means:**
The system is shifting from static rule-based weighting to AI-driven content evaluation. This creates both stability and volatility—opportunity for small accounts, but also period of unpredictability.

## Core Insights: What Always Wins

Regardless of algorithmic changes, these fundamentals remain constant:

### 1. Replies > Likes (Dramatically)
- **One meaningful reply = ~150 likes algorithmically**
- This shows the platform's prioritization of conversation over passive consumption
- Content designed to generate replies always outperforms engagement-bait

### 2. Video > Everything
- 80% of user sessions include watching video
- Video content receives highest algorithmic weighting
- Sweet spot: 10+ second watch time, engaging first 3 seconds

### 3. Quality > Quantity
- The new AI system can distinguish genuine insight from engagement manipulation
- Small accounts with quality content now have unprecedented opportunity
- Authentic community building beats vanity metrics

### 4. Audience Understanding > Optimization
- Know your specific audience's active hours (not generic "best times")
- Understand what drives *your* audience's engagement
- Build for your niche, not for global trends

### 5. Speed Matters (In First Hours)
- First 2-3 hours after posting determine algorithmic trajectory
- Being online to respond to early engagement is critical
- Quick response signals strength of content to the algorithm

## Current Ranking Signals (Being Phased Out)

These weights apply to the heuristic system currently in place. As Grok AI takes over, weights will become dynamic and context-dependent, but these priorities likely persist:

| Signal | Weight | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Reply + Author Engagement | +75 | Conversation is king |
| User Replies | +13.5 | Quality replies matter |
| Profile Engagement | +12 | Audience credibility matters |
| Conversation Click & Engage | +11 | Deep engagement signals value |
| Dwell Time (2+ min) | +10 | Time spent = content quality |
| Retweet | +1.0 | Sharing is endorsement |
| Like | +0.5 | Baseline signal |
| Video Watch (50%+) | +0.005 | Video is a different tier |

**Key Insight:** The dramatic weighting gap (replies = 150x likes) shows X's core philosophy—conversation is the ultimate value signal.

---

## Content Performance Hierarchy

What gets algorithmic priority (in order):

1. **Video content** - Especially videos with high completion rate and watch time
2. **High dwell time posts** - Content people spend time reading/watching
3. **Conversation-generating content** - Posts that inspire replies
4. **Quotes & bookmarks** - Active engagement signals
5. **Rich media** - Images, GIFs, polls, carousels
6. **Text-only posts** - Still viable but lower priority than rich media

---

## Content That Gets Suppressed

What the algorithm actively limits:

| Penalty | Impact | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Offensive content | -80% reach | Flagged as harmful |
| All caps text | Moderate | "POSTS LIKE THIS" get suppressed |
| Links (being revisited) | Significant* | *Status changing in October 2025 |
| Negative user signals | Cumulative | Blocks, mutes, reports |
| Low-quality indicators | Ongoing | Spam-like behavior, bots |

---

## Account Credibility Factors

Your account's reputation affects every post:

**Boost signals:**
- Verified/Premium status
- Consistent posting history
- Favorable follower-to-following ratio
- Clean account history (no violations)
- Established account age

**Penalty signals:**
- Account warnings or restrictions
- High report count
- Negative engagement ratio
- Sudden behavioral changes
- Bot-like patterns

## Using This Intelligence

### For Content Creation
1. Read [Engagement Optimization](/x-execution/algorithm/engagement-optimization.md)
2. Design posts to generate conversation (not just consumption)
3. Prioritize video and rich media
4. Understand your specific audience's active hours

### For Strategic Planning
1. Check [Algorithm Trends](/x-execution/algorithm/algorithm-trends.md) for latest changes
2. Prepare for conversational customization (November launch)
3. Build niche positioning for feed discovery
4. Plan for volatility during transition period

### For Monitoring Changes
1. Follow [X Platform Updates](/x-execution/algorithm/x-platform-updates.md)
2. Monitor @XEng for official announcements
3. Track bi-weekly open-source algorithm releases
4. Adjust tactics based on measured performance

## The Transition Period (Now Through December 2025)

**What to expect:**
- Reach volatility as system transitions
- Some tactics that work now may change
- New opportunities as AI evaluation launches
- Increased transparency through open-source updates

**How to adapt:**
- Measure performance weekly
- Stay informed via official X channels
- Focus on fundamentals (quality, conversation, consistency)
- Test and refine as system evolves
- Prepare for conversational customization

## Integration With Content Creation

Use algorithm insights when creating content:

1. **Phase 1 (Ideation):** Know the core message
2. **Phase 4 (Variations):** Design variations that are algorithmically sound
   - Ensure they generate conversation (replies)
   - Consider video opportunities
   - Build in rich media
   - Optimize for your audience's active hours
3. **Phase 5 (Review):** Select variations that perform well algorithmically

See [Creating Content Workflow](/x-execution/workflows/creating-content.md) for integration guidance.
