2. Go to: Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Add `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`:
   - Obtain from Claude Code OAuth settings
   - Paste token value
   - Save secret

   - Create webhook in Slack for `#changelog-errors` channel
   - Paste webhook URL
   - Save secret

**Validation:**
- [ ] Both secrets appear in secrets list
- [ ] No typos in secret names (exact match required)
- [ ] Test Slack webhook with curl command

---

### Step 2: Deploy GitHub Action Workflow

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Actions:**
1. Verify `.github/workflows/changelog-update.yml` exists
2. Commit workflow file to main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/changelog-update.yml
   git commit -m "feat: add CHANGELOG auto-update workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
4. Verify workflow appears in workflow list

**Validation:**
- [ ] Workflow file committed to main
- [ ] Workflow appears in Actions tab
- [ ] No YAML syntax errors reported

---

### Step 3: Test Scenario 1 - Happy Path (Single Domain)

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Objective:** Verify basic CHANGELOG update for single domain change.

**Procedure:**

1. **Create test branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/changelog-voice-update
   ```

2. **Modify voice strategy:**
   ```bash
   # Edit brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md
   # Add a test section:
   ```
   ```markdown
   ## Testing Guidelines (TEST)
   - This is a test change for CHANGELOG automation
   - Will validate end-to-end workflow execution
   ```

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md
   git commit -m "test: add voice guidelines for CHANGELOG automation test"
   git push origin test/changelog-voice-update
   ```

4. **Create pull request:**
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Create PR from `test/changelog-voice-update` to `main`
   - Title: "Test: CHANGELOG automation for voice domain"
   - Leave as draft initially

5. **Mark ready for review:**
   - Click "Ready for review" button
   - This triggers the workflow

6. **Monitor workflow:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Find the workflow run
   - Watch execution in real-time
   - Expected duration: 2-5 minutes

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Workflow triggers within 30 seconds
- [ ] "Detect strategy changes" step shows `voice/STRATEGY.md` changed
- [ ] "Run Claude Code" step executes successfully
- [ ] New commit appears in PR: "docs: update CHANGELOG for strategy changes"
- [ ] Commit author is `github-actions[bot]`
- [ ] Commit message includes Claude co-author
- [ ] `brand/strategy/voice/CHANGELOG.md` updated with new entry
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry format is correct:
  - [ ] Has today's date
  - [ ] Type field is populated (likely "Updated")
  - [ ] Changes bullets describe the addition
  - [ ] "Why it matters" section explains impact
  - [ ] Professional tone, Marketing Architect audience
- [ ] Bot comments on PR: "âœ… CHANGELOG Updated"
- [ ] Workflow completes with success status

**Validation Actions:**
1. Review CHANGELOG entry quality:
   - Does it accurately describe changes?
   - Is the tone appropriate?
   - Is formatting correct?
2. Check git attribution:
   ```bash
   git log --format="%an <%ae>" -n 1
   # Should show: github-actions[bot] <...>
   ```
3. Verify commit message includes co-author

**If Successful:**
- [ ] Document any adjustments needed to CHANGELOG entry
- [ ] Merge or close PR
- [ ] Proceed to next test

**If Failed:**
- [ ] Review workflow logs for errors
- [ ] Check Slack for error notification
- [ ] Consult troubleshooting guide (Phase 4 artifact)
- [ ] Fix issues and retry

---

### Step 4: Test Scenario 2 - Multiple Domains

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Objective:** Verify CHANGELOG updates for multiple domains in single PR.

**Procedure:**

1. **Create test branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/changelog-multi-domain
   ```

2. **Modify multiple strategy files:**
   - Edit `brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md`
   - Edit `brand/strategy/messaging/STRATEGY.md`
   - Make distinct changes to each

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add brand/strategy/voice/STRATEGY.md brand/strategy/messaging/STRATEGY.md
   git commit -m "test: multi-domain CHANGELOG automation"
   git push origin test/changelog-multi-domain
   ```

4. **Create PR and mark ready for review**

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Workflow triggers
- [ ] Both `voice/CHANGELOG.md` and `messaging/CHANGELOG.md` updated
- [ ] Single commit contains both CHANGELOG updates
- [ ] Both entries have same date
- [ ] Entries are domain-specific (not identical)

**Validation:**
- Verify both CHANGELOGs show separate, accurate entries
- Confirm changes are domain-appropriate

---

### Step 5: Test Scenario 3 - Error Handling

**Duration:** 10 minutes

**Objective:** Verify error handling and Slack notifications.

**Procedure:**

1. **Temporarily invalidate secret:**
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Secrets
   - Delete or rename `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
   - Note: This will cause workflow to fail (intentional)

2. **Create PR with STRATEGY.md changes:**
   - Create test branch
   - Modify a STRATEGY.md file
   - Create PR and mark ready for review

3. **Monitor workflow failure:**
   - Watch workflow in Actions tab
   - Should fail at "Run Claude Code" step

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Workflow triggers
- [ ] "Run Claude Code" step fails
- [ ] Error handler executes
- [ ] Slack message posted to `#changelog-errors`
- [ ] Slack message includes:
  - [ ] Clear error indication
  - [ ] PR link (clickable)
  - [ ] Branch name
  - [ ] "View Workflow" button with correct link
- [ ] PR is not blocked (can still be merged if needed)

**Validation:**
- Check Slack channel for error notification
- Click links in Slack message to verify they work
- Confirm error message is actionable

**Cleanup:**
- Restore `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret
- Close test PR

---

### Step 6: Test Scenario 4 - Already Up to Date

**Duration:** 10 minutes

**Objective:** Verify system skips update when CHANGELOG already reflects changes.

**Procedure:**

1. **Create branch with manual CHANGELOG:**
   - Create test branch
   - Modify `brand/strategy/positioning/STRATEGY.md`
   - Manually update `brand/strategy/positioning/CHANGELOG.md` with entry describing the changes
   - Commit both files together
   - Push and create PR

2. **Mark PR ready for review**

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Workflow triggers
- [ ] Claude analyzes changes
- [ ] Detects CHANGELOG already updated
- [ ] Workflow completes successfully
- [ ] No additional commit (CHANGELOG not modified)
- [ ] No bot comment

**Validation:**
- Check workflow logs for "already up to date" or similar message
- Verify manual CHANGELOG entry is preserved exactly

- [ ] Set expectations for human oversight

### Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor first 5-10 real PRs for CHANGELOG quality
- [ ] Gather feedback from team
- [ ] Track success rate and error rate
- [ ] Document common issues

---

## Success Criteria

Mark Phase 1 implementation complete when:

- [x] All code components created and deployed
- [ ] GitHub secrets configured correctly
- [ ] Happy path test successful (Scenario 1)
- [ ] Multi-domain test successful (Scenario 2)
- [ ] Error handling verified (Scenario 3)
- [ ] Edge case handling verified (Scenario 4)
- [ ] No critical issues blocking usage
- [ ] Team notified and documented
- [ ] Monitoring plan in place

---

## Known Limitations

Document any known limitations or caveats:

1. **CHANGELOG quality depends on diff clarity**
   - Complex or large diffs may produce generic entries
   - Mitigation: Human review during PR process

2. **First-time execution may be slower**
   - Cold start for Claude Code action
   - Subsequent runs are faster

3. **Branch protection rules may conflict**
   - If branch requires reviews, bot commit counts as update
   - May require re-approval after CHANGELOG commit

4. **Relies on external services**
   - Claude Code API availability
   - Slack webhook availability
   - GitHub Actions availability

---

## Next Steps

After Phase 1 completion:

### Phase 2: Strategy Communications (Future)
- [ ] Create comms agent for Slack notifications on merge
- [ ] Implement `strategy-comms.yml` workflow
- [ ] Test stakeholder messaging

### Phase 3: CHANGELOG Migration (Future)
- [ ] Test `/migrate-changelog` command
- [ ] Backfill CHANGELOGs for incomplete domains
- [ ] Document migration process

### Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Monitor CHANGELOG quality over 2 weeks
- [ ] Gather team feedback
- [ ] Refine prompts and formatting
- [ ] Optimize workflow performance
- [ ] Document lessons learned
