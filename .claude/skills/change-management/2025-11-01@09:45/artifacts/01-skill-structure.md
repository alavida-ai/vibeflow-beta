# Phase 1 Artifact: Skill Structure & Documentation

**Phase:** 1 - Skill Structure & Documentation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** 2025-11-01

## Deliverables

### 1. Skill Directory Structure

Created the following structure:

```
.claude/skills/change-management/
├── SKILL.md                                    ✅ Created
└── workflows/
    ├── update-changelog/
    │   └── WORKFLOW.md                         ✅ Created
    └── migrate-changelog/
        └── WORKFLOW.md                         ✅ Created
```

### 2. SKILL.md

**Location:** `.claude/skills/change-management/SKILL.md`

**Contents:**
- Frontmatter metadata (name, description)
- Purpose and when to use the skill
- Available workflows (update, migrate)
- Key principles for change management
- CHANGELOG format specification
- Tone guidelines for Marketing Architect audience
- Domain context (strategy domains)

**Design decisions:**
- Follows existing skill pattern from `researching` skill
- Uses imperative/infinitive form per skill-creator guidelines
- Includes concrete CHANGELOG format example
- References strategy domains but uses progressive disclosure (doesn't load full content)

### 3. Update CHANGELOG Workflow

**Location:** `.claude/skills/change-management/workflows/update-changelog/WORKFLOW.md`

**Contents:**
- Objective and context
- Detailed 5-step process:
  1. Detect changed domains
  2. Analyze each domain (context, diff, determine if update needed)
  3. Generate CHANGELOG entry (with component breakdown)
  4. Update CHANGELOG file (insertion logic, create if missing)
  5. Commit changes
- Validation checklist
- Error handling strategy
- Output specification

**Key features:**
- Smart detection logic (only update if needed)
- Comprehensive entry generation guidance
- Handles missing CHANGELOG gracefully
- Fallback strategy for incomplete information

### 4. Migrate CHANGELOG Workflow

**Location:** `.claude/skills/change-management/workflows/migrate-changelog/WORKFLOW.md`

**Contents:**
- Objective and context (one-time backfill operation)
- Detailed 6-step process:
  1. Validate domain
  2. Analyze git history
  3. Preserve existing CHANGELOG
  4. Generate historical entries
  5. Update CHANGELOG file
  6. Validation
- Special formatting for migrated entries
- Error handling for various scenarios
- Post-migration checklist

**Key features:**
- Marks migrated entries clearly: `[Migrated from git history]`
- Handles incomplete git history gracefully
- Preserves existing manual entries
- Acknowledges uncertainty in historical context

## Validation Results

### SKILL.md Validation
- [x] Follows existing skill pattern conventions
- [x] Uses imperative/infinitive form throughout
- [x] Clear frontmatter with name and description
- [x] References workflows appropriately
- [x] Includes concrete format examples
- [x] Respects Marketing Architect audience

### Workflow Documentation Validation
- [x] Clear objectives and context
- [x] Step-by-step processes
- [x] Validation checklists included
- [x] Error handling defined
- [x] Actionable for Claude execution
- [x] Progressive disclosure (references files, doesn't duplicate)

### File Structure Validation
- [x] Matches `.claude/skills/` conventions
- [x] Workflows in proper subdirectories
- [x] Clear naming (update-changelog, migrate-changelog)
- [x] No unnecessary files or placeholders

## Context Used

**Reference files read:**
- `.claude/skills/researching/SKILL.md` - Pattern reference
- `.claude/skills/change-management/2025-11-01@09:45/PLAN.md` - Implementation plan
- CLAUDE.md (in context) - CHANGELOG format specifications

**Patterns followed:**
- Skill-creator guidelines for SKILL.md structure
- Orchestration principles for workflow definition
- Progressive disclosure (reference research, don't duplicate)
- Marketing Architect tone and language

## Notes

- Workflows designed for both manual invocation (via commands) and automated execution (via GitHub Actions)
- CHANGELOG format aligns with existing patterns observed in `/brand/strategy/*/CHANGELOG.md` files
- Documentation assumes Claude will execute these workflows, so instructions are clear and procedural
- Migration workflow is placeholder for Phase 3 but fully specified for future use

## Next Phase

Phase 2: Create command definitions that invoke these workflows.
