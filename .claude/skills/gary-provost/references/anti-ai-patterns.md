# Anti-AI Writing Patterns

This reference contains patterns to AVOID and natural writing markers to EMBRACE. The goal is writing that sounds like a confident human, not an AI trying to sound sophisticated.

## Banned Elements - Never Use

### Punctuation
- **Em dashes (—)**: Always use regular hyphens (-) or restructure the sentence
- **Emojis**: Never use any emoji under any circumstances

### AI Clichés - Phrases That Scream "AI Wrote This"
- "Delve into"
- "In today's digital landscape"
- "In the ever-evolving world of"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "It's important to remember"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Dive deep into"
- "Unlock the potential"
- "Game-changer"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Leverage" (when "use" works fine)
- "Robust" (overused)
- "Streamline" (overused)
- "Synergy"
- "Paradigm shift"

### Excessive Transition Words
Limit use of these formal connectors:
- "Indeed"
- "Moreover"
- "Furthermore"
- "Nevertheless"
- "Consequently"
- "Thus"
- "Hence"

Use sparingly and only when they genuinely improve flow.

### Over-Formatting Patterns
- Multiple colons for dramatic effect (e.g., "Here's the truth: it's simple: just do it")
- Excessive bolding for emphasis
- Lists when prose works better
- Headers for every single point

## Natural Writing Markers - Embrace These

### Simple Punctuation
- Periods
- Commas
- Regular hyphens (-)
- Question marks
- Exclamation points (used sparingly)

### Conversational Elements
- **Contractions**: Don't avoid them. They're natural. You'll sound more human.
- **Sentence fragments**: When they work. Like this.
- **Starting with And/But**: Natural speakers do this. And it's perfectly fine.
- **One-word sentences**: Sometimes. Really. Absolutely.

### Real Human Rhythm
- Mix declarative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentences
- Use parenthetical asides (they add personality)
- Include rhetorical questions when appropriate
- Vary paragraph length dramatically

### Specific Over Generic
Instead of: "It's important to consider various factors"
Write: "Think about cost, time, and team capacity"

Instead of: "There are multiple approaches one could take"
Write: "You could do X, Y, or Z"

### Active Voice Preference
Instead of: "It was determined that the project should be halted"
Write: "We halted the project"

### Direct Address
Instead of: "One might find that..."
Write: "You'll find that..."

## The Ultimate Test

Read your writing aloud. If you wouldn't say it to a colleague over coffee, rewrite it.

Good: "Here's what works. Short sentences. Clear points. No fluff."

Bad: "Moreover, it is worth noting that one should endeavor to leverage concise communication strategies to effectively streamline the conveyance of information."
