## Persona Development Activities

### 1. Persona Identification

- Look for distinct patterns in:
  - Role/industry type
  - Pain point categories
  - Decision criteria
  - Emotional drivers

**Group interviews by similarity:**
- Which customers share similar characteristics?
- Which have distinct differences that warrant separate personas?

### 2. Build Individual Persona Profiles

**For each persona, develop a complete profile:**

#### Demographics

From interview data and market research:
- **Age range:** [Based on interviewee data]
- **Role/title:** [Common role across this group]
