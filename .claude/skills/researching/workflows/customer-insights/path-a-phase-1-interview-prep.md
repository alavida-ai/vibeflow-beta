## Interview Guide Development

### Create Flexible Interview Guide

**Important:** This is a guide, not a rigid script. Adapt based on what you hear.

#### 1. Opening Context (5-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand the customer's situation and discovery path

Questions to include:
- "How did you first discover [brand]?"
- "What problem or situation led you to look for a solution like this?"
- "What other options or alternatives did you consider?"
- "Had you tried anything else before finding [brand]?"

#### 2. Problem Deep-Dive (10-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Uncover emotional pain points and functional frustrations

Questions to include:
- "Describe what life/work was like before you found [brand]. What was frustrating you?"
- "How were you feeling emotionally during that time?" (anxious? overwhelmed? frustrated? stuck?)
- "What specifically wasn't working with your previous approach?"
- "How did this problem affect you personally? Professionally?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't found a solution?"

**Probing technique:** Ask "why" or "tell me more about that" at least 3 times to go deeper.

#### 3. Evaluation & Decision (10-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand decision criteria and competitive positioning

Questions to include:
- "What made you choose [brand] over the alternatives?"
- "What almost stopped you from choosing [brand]? What were your hesitations?"
- "When you described [brand] to your team/boss/peers, what did you say?"
- "What were you hoping would change by using [brand]?"
- "What would have been your second choice if [brand] didn't exist?"

#### 4. Transformation & Outcome (10-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Capture the "after" state and identity shift

Questions to include:
- "What changed after you started using [brand]?"
- "How do you feel now compared to before?"
- "What can you do now that you couldn't do before?"
- "How has your role or work changed since using [brand]?"
- "If someone in your old situation asked for advice, what would you tell them?"

#### 5. Language Capture (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Get exact customer language for messaging

Questions to include:
- "Complete this sentence: Before [brand], I was ____. Now I'm ____."
- "If you were describing the main benefit of [brand] to a colleague, what would you say?"
- "What words would you use to describe [brand]?"

## Interview Principles

Provide these principles to the user:

### Do's:
- ✅ Listen for emotion, not just facts
- ✅ Ask "why" multiple times to get deeper (3-5 layers)
- ✅ Capture exact language - quotes matter!
- ✅ Look for identity shifts ("I was X, now I'm Y")
- ✅ Follow interesting threads even if not in the guide
- ✅ Create safe space - empathize with their struggles

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Rush through questions
- ❌ Lead the witness ("So you must have been frustrated, right?")
- ❌ Skip the emotional questions
- ❌ Paraphrase - capture their exact words
- ❌ Interrupt their stories
- ❌ Ask yes/no questions when you want depth

## Handoff Instructions

### User Handoff Message

Provide this to the user:

```
I've prepared an interview guide for your customer interviews. This is a flexible guide, not a rigid script - adapt based on what you hear and follow interesting threads.

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Listen for emotion, not just facts
- Ask "why" multiple times to go deeper (3-5 layers)
- Capture their exact language (quotes matter!)
- Look for identity shifts ("I was X, now I'm Y")
- Create safe space - empathize with their struggles

INTERVIEW STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Context (5-10 min) - How they found you, what problem they had
2. Problem Deep-Dive (10-15 min) - Emotional state, frustrations, impact
3. Evaluation & Decision (10-15 min) - Why they chose you, hesitations, alternatives
4. Transformation & Outcome (10-15 min) - What changed, how they feel now
5. Language Capture (5 min) - Their exact words describing before/after

TIME NEEDED: 45-60 minutes per interview

WHAT TO CAPTURE:
- Audio recording or detailed notes (verbatim quotes preferred)
- Their emotional state before and after
- Exact language they use
- Decision criteria and hesitations
- Identity transformation (who they were → who they've become)

After you complete the interviews, share the transcripts or detailed notes with me and I'll analyze for strategic insights and persona development.

How many customers can you interview? Aim for 2-3 if possible.
```

## Follow-up Confirmation

After providing the guide:

1. **Confirm interview timeline:** "When do you plan to conduct these interviews?"
2. **Confirm format:** "Will you be recording audio, taking detailed notes, or both?"
3. **Confirm handoff:** "After the interviews, you can share transcripts or detailed notes - whichever is easier for you."
4. **Set expectations:** "Once I have the interview data, I'll analyze for themes, emotional drivers, and persona insights."
