## Note on Strategic Synthesis

This research report provides validated customer insights for brand strategy development. The findings will inform:
- **Audience strategy synthesis** (`/strategy:audience`) - Which personas to prioritize, how to segment
- **Positioning strategy refinement** (`/strategy:positioning`) - Validated positioning territory and differentiation
- **Messaging strategy creation** (`/strategy:messaging`) - Customer language, pain points, transformation narratives

**This document presents WHAT IS (customer needs and experiences), not WHAT SHOULD BE (brand strategy and tactics).**
