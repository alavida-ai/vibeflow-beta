## Customer Collection Activities

### 1. Initial Customer Request

**Ask user to describe 2-3 real customers:**

```
To build accurate customer personas, I need you to describe 2-3 REAL customers -
not theoretical personas, but actual people who chose your brand.

For each customer, please tell me:
- Their name (or pseudonym) and role
- The situation they were in when they found you
- Why they chose you over alternatives
- What changed for them after using your product/service

Let's start with Customer #1. Who comes to mind?
```

### 2. Deep Questioning Framework

**For each customer the user describes, probe 3-5 layers deep across these dimensions:**

#### Layer 1: Basic Description (From user's initial response)

Capture:
- Name/pseudonym
- Role/title
- Industry/context
- Initial situation

#### Layer 2: Problem & Emotional State

**Ask questions like:**
- "What was [Name] feeling emotionally before finding you?"
- "What specific problem or frustration were they experiencing?"
- "How was this problem affecting their work/life?"
- "What had they tried before that didn't work?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What made them feel that way?"
- "How did that impact them?"

#### Layer 3: Decision Journey & Psychology

**Ask questions like:**
- "When [Name] was evaluating you, what were they afraid of? What were they hoping for?"
- "What alternatives did they consider? Why didn't they choose those?"
- "What almost stopped them from choosing you?"
- "How did [Name] describe you to their team/boss/peers?"
- "What gave them confidence to choose you?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Why was that important to them?"
- "What would have happened if they hadn't chosen you?"
- "What was the moment they decided?"

#### Layer 4: Transformation & Identity

**Ask questions like:**
- "What changed for [Name] after they started using your product/service?"
- "How did they feel AFTER compared to BEFORE?"
- "What can they do now that they couldn't do before?"
- "What kind of person was [Name] trying to become?"
- "How do they see themselves differently now?"

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How did that transformation happen?"
- "What surprised them about the change?"

#### Layer 5: Language & Articulation

**Ask questions like:**
- "If [Name] was describing their problem to a colleague, what exact words would they use?"
- "How does [Name] describe what you do? What words do they use?"
- "If [Name] completed this sentence: 'Before [brand], I was ___. Now I'm ___' - what would they say?"
- "What's a quote you remember from [Name] about their experience?"

### 3. Questioning Technique

**Go 3-5 layers deep on EACH dimension:**

**Example of layered questioning:**

```
User: "Sarah was overwhelmed by managing multiple tools."

You: "Tell me more about what that overwhelm felt like for Sarah."

User: "She felt like she was constantly context-switching and couldn't focus."

You: "How did that inability to focus affect her work or how she felt about herself?"

User: "She felt like she wasn't being strategic - just reactive all the time."

You: "What kind of person did Sarah want to be instead? What was she aspiring to?"

User: "She wanted to be a strategic leader, not just a task manager."

You: "So when she found your product, what transformation did she hope for regarding her identity as a leader?"
```

**Keep probing until you hit:**
- Emotional core (not just functional problems)
- Identity aspirations (who they want to become)
- Exact language (words they actually use)
- Transformation narrative (before → after)

### 4. Documentation During Collection

**As user describes each customer, document in real-time:**

Create a running note structure:
```markdown
## Customer 1: [Name/Pseudonym]

### Demographics
- Role:
- Industry:
- Context:

### Initial Situation
[User's description of what was happening]

### Problem Deep-Dive
**Functional problem:**
**Emotional state:**
**Impact:**

### Decision Psychology
**Why chose us:**
**Alternatives considered:**
**Hesitations:**
**Confidence factors:**

### Transformation
**Functional change:**
**Emotional change:**
**Identity shift:**

### Language Captured
**How they describe problem:**
**How they describe solution:**
**Memorable quotes:**

### Follow-up Questions Needed
[Note any gaps to circle back on]
```

### 5. Completeness Check

**After initial description of each customer, verify completeness:**

Check that you have captured:
- [ ] Demographics (role, industry, context)
- [ ] Functional problem (specific issues)
- [ ] Emotional state (how they felt)
- [ ] Decision factors (why they chose this brand)
- [ ] Alternatives considered
- [ ] Hesitations or barriers
- [ ] Functional transformation (what changed practically)
- [ ] Emotional transformation (how they feel now)
- [ ] Identity shift (who they were → who they've become)
- [ ] Exact language (words they use)

**If gaps exist, ask additional probing questions to fill them.**

### 6. Iterative Refinement

**After collecting all 2-3 customers:**

1. **Review profiles together:**
   - "Looking at these three customers, are there any patterns you notice?"
   - "What similarities stand out to you?"
   - "Are there differences that surprise you?"

2. **Enrich with additional context:**
   - "Is there anything else about [Customer] that would help me understand them better?"
   - "What makes [Customer] representative of your typical customer?"

3. **Validate understanding:**
   - Summarize each customer back to user
   - Check for accuracy
   - Refine based on user corrections
