## Context Required

You will receive:
- Customer profiles from Phase 1 (user descriptions)
- Market research enrichment from Phase 2
- Research objectives

## Persona Synthesis Activities

### 1. Persona Structuring

**Determine final persona structure:**

Review enriched customer profiles and decide:
- Should each customer become a separate persona? (if distinctly different)
- Should similar customers be merged into a composite persona?
- How many final personas will you create? (typically 2-3)

**Grouping logic:**
- Group by similar role/industry if patterns match
- Separate if pain points or decision journeys differ significantly
- Aim for distinct, actionable personas
