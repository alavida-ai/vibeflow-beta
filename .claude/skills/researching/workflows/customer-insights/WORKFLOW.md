# Research Customer Insights

Build deep psychographic understanding of the target audience and validate positioning hypotheses through customer research.

---

## Research Objective

**Goal:** Develop rich persona profiles with validated emotional drivers, jobs-to-be-done clarity, and customer language patterns.

**Inputs:**
- Founder's customer hypothesis (if available from founder interview research)
- Positioning hypotheses to validate (if available from category landscape research)
- Access to customers (interviews) OR detailed customer descriptions from user

**Output:**
- Published research report with 2-3 detailed personas, emotional validation, decision criteria, and customer language mapping

**Key questions to answer:**
- Do customers actually feel the pain points we've hypothesized?
- Does our positioning territory resonate emotionally?
- What language do customers use that we should mirror?

## Research Phases

### Phase 0: Path Selection

**Purpose:** Determine research approach based on customer access.

**Activities:**
- Ask user about customer access availability
- Confirm research path (interviews vs. profiling)
- Set expectations for each approach

**Two paths available:**
- **Path A:** User has access to 2-3 customers for interviews
- **Path B:** User describes customers, research team enriches with market data

**Phase output:** Selected research path and confirmed approach

### Path A (Interviews): Phase 1 - Interview Preparation

**Purpose:** Prepare interview guide for user to conduct customer interviews.

**Instructions:** [path-a-phase-1-interview-prep.md](path-a-phase-1-interview-prep.md)

**Research activities:**
- Create flexible interview guide covering problem deep-dive, decision journey, transformation, and language capture
- Provide interview principles to user
- Set up handoff process for transcript collection

**Phase output:** Interview guide and user handoff

## Research Principles

**Core principles for customer insights research:**

1. **Emotion over demographics** - Psychographics matter more than age/gender
2. **Language matters** - Capture exact words customers use
3. **Identity transformation** - Look for before/after identity shifts
4. **Jobs-to-be-done** - Understand functional + emotional + social jobs
5. **Validate, don't assume** - Test hypotheses against real customer data
6. **Depth over breadth** - 2-3 deeply understood personas > 10 surface-level profiles
7. **Real customers only** - Focus on actual people who chose the brand, not theoretical personas
