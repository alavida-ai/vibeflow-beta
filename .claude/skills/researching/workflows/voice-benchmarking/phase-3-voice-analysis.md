# Phase 3: Voice Attribute Analysis

## Objective

Deconstruct each brand's voice into specific, observable attributes and patterns to understand what makes their voice distinctive.

---

## Context Required

You will receive:
- Voice samples organized by brand and channel from Phase 2

---

## Research Activities

### 1. Voice Attribute Identification

For each brand, analyze samples to identify:

**Core Voice Characteristics:**
- Conversational vs. Formal
- Playful vs. Serious
- Authoritative vs. Humble
- Direct vs. Nuanced
- Warm vs. Professional
- Bold vs. Reserved

Document 3-5 primary attributes that define the brand's voice.

### 2. Tone Spectrum Analysis

Map each brand on key tone dimensions:

**Formality Spectrum:**
- Formal ←→ Casual

**Emotion Spectrum:**
- Serious ←→ Humorous

**Authority Spectrum:**
- Respectful ←→ Irreverent

**Directness Spectrum:**
- Straightforward ←→ Subtle

Provide specific evidence from samples for each positioning.

### 3. Writing Principles Extraction

Identify observable writing principles:

**Sentence Structure:**
- Length patterns (short and punchy vs. flowing and complex)
- Rhythm and cadence
- Use of fragments or complete sentences

**Vocabulary Choices:**
- Industry jargon vs. plain language
- Technical terms vs. metaphors
- Formal vs. colloquial language
- Distinctive word choices or phrases

**Grammatical Patterns:**
- Active vs. passive voice
- First person (we/I) vs. third person
- Questions vs. statements
- Use of imperatives

### 4. Distinctive Voice Elements

Document what makes this voice unique:

**Storytelling Approach:**
- Narrative-driven vs. fact-driven
- Personal anecdotes vs. general examples
- Customer stories vs. brand stories

**Humor & Personality:**
- Type of humor (witty, self-deprecating, playful, none)
- Personality traits expressed
- Emotional connection strategies

**Visual Language:**
- Metaphors and analogies used
- Imagery and descriptive language
- Concrete vs. abstract language

### 5. Channel Adaptations

Note how voice adapts across channels:
- Does formality shift from website to social?
- Are certain voice elements consistent everywhere?
- Channel-specific voice variations observed

## Analysis Framework

For each brand, create a structured analysis:

```markdown
## [Brand Name] Voice Analysis

### Core Voice Attributes
- [Attribute 1]: [Evidence from samples]
- [Attribute 2]: [Evidence from samples]
- [Attribute 3]: [Evidence from samples]

### Tone Spectrum Positioning
- Formality: [Position + evidence]
- Emotion: [Position + evidence]
- Authority: [Position + evidence]
- Directness: [Position + evidence]

### Writing Principles
**Sentence Structure:** [Observations with examples]
**Vocabulary:** [Observations with examples]
**Grammar Patterns:** [Observations with examples]

### Distinctive Elements
- [What makes this voice unique]
- [Signature patterns or phrases]
- [Memorable characteristics]

### Channel Adaptations
- [How voice shifts across channels]
```

## Research Tools

Use analytical capabilities:
- Pattern recognition across samples
- Comparative text analysis
- Linguistic pattern identification
- Evidence extraction from samples

---

## Deliverable

Create a comprehensive artifact containing:
- Individual voice analysis for each brand
- Specific evidence from samples supporting each observation
- Clear attribute definitions with examples
- Tone spectrum mappings with justification

**Format:** Markdown document with per-brand analysis sections

---

## Quality Checks

Before completing this phase:
- [ ] Each brand has 3-5 clearly defined voice attributes
- [ ] Tone spectrum positions are supported by specific evidence
- [ ] Writing principles include concrete examples from samples
- [ ] Distinctive elements are clearly articulated
- [ ] Channel adaptations are documented (if observed)
- [ ] Analysis is descriptive (findings), not prescriptive (recommendations)
