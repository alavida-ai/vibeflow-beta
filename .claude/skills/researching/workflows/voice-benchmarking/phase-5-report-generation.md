# Phase 5: Research Report Generation

## Objective

Synthesize all voice benchmarking findings into a comprehensive, well-structured research report that documents observed voice patterns, principles, and characteristics from analyzed brands.

---

## Context Required

You will receive:
- Brand selection with rationale from Phase 1
- Voice samples from Phase 2
- Voice attribute analysis from Phase 3
- Cross-brand pattern analysis from Phase 4

---

## Report Generation Activities

### 1. Synthesis Preparation

Review all artifacts to prepare synthesis:
- Consolidate findings from individual brand analyses
- Integrate cross-brand pattern insights
- Identify key themes and observations
- Organize evidence hierarchically

### 2. Report Structure Development

Using the template provided, develop each section:

#### Section 1: Benchmark Brand Profiles
- Overview of each analyzed brand
- User's rationale for selection (from Phase 1)
- Brief context on each brand's market position
- Why these brands were chosen as voice benchmarks

#### Section 2: Voice Attribute Analysis
- Detailed breakdown of each brand's voice characteristics
- Core attributes per brand with evidence
- Distinctive voice elements
- What makes each voice unique

#### Section 3: Common Patterns
- Voice principles observed across multiple brands
- Recurring attributes and characteristics
- Shared writing principles
- Patterns in successful brand voices

#### Section 4: Differentiation Strategies
- How each brand creates a distinctive voice
- Unique positioning approaches
- Differentiation mechanisms observed
- Voice uniqueness factors

#### Section 5: Tone Spectrum Analysis
- Mapping of all brands on key dimensions:
  - Formality (Formal ↔ Casual)
  - Emotion (Serious ↔ Humorous)
  - Authority (Respectful ↔ Irreverent)
  - Directness (Straightforward ↔ Subtle)
- Evidence for each brand's positioning
- Clustering and outlier observations

#### Section 6: Writing Principles Observed
- Sentence structure patterns
- Vocabulary and language choices
- Grammar patterns (active/passive voice, POV, etc.)
- Rhythm and cadence observations
- Evidence from analyzed samples

#### Section 7: Channel Adaptations
- How brands adapt voice across platforms
- Consistent elements across channels
- Channel-specific variations observed
- Platform-appropriate voice shifts

#### Section 8: Voice Elements Inventory
- Observed "do's" from successful voices
- Common approaches across benchmarks
- Distinctive tactics that create memorable voices
- Evidence-based observations (not recommendations)

### 3. Evidence Integration

Throughout the report:
- Support every observation with specific evidence
- Quote sample text when illustrative
- Reference multiple brands when documenting patterns
- Maintain unopinionated, descriptive tone

### 4. Findings Framing

Ensure the report:
- Presents FINDINGS, not recommendations
- Remains descriptive and analytical
- Avoids prescriptive language ("you should...")
- Documents observations without strategic conclusions
- Provides evidence for future strategy synthesis

## Report Template

Use the provided template: [templates/voice-benchmarking-output.md](templates/voice-benchmarking-output.md)

The template includes:
- Structured section headings
- Guidance on content for each section
- Formatting conventions
- Evidence integration patterns

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone & Style
- Analytical and objective
- Evidence-based observations
- Descriptive rather than prescriptive
- Clear and well-organized

### Language Patterns
- "Observed patterns show..."
- "Analysis reveals..."
- "Across the benchmark brands..."
- "Evidence suggests..."
- Avoid: "You should...", "We recommend...", "The best approach..."

### Evidence Standards
- Include specific quotes from samples
- Reference multiple brands for patterns
- Provide context for observations
- Link findings to specific brands

---

## Deliverable

Create the final research report containing:
- All 8 sections fully developed
- Evidence-supported findings throughout
- Clear organization following template
- Proper markdown formatting
- Professional, analytical tone

**Format:** Markdown document following provided template structure

- [ ] Brand profiles include user's selection rationale
- [ ] Tone spectrum mappings include all brands with justification
- [ ] Writing principles are illustrated with examples
- [ ] Channel adaptations are documented where observed
- [ ] Voice elements inventory presents findings (not recommendations)
- [ ] Report is ready for strategy synthesis phase
- [ ] Markdown formatting is clean and consistent

## Note on Strategic Synthesis

This research report provides the FOUNDATION for voice strategy development. The strategic recommendations, decisions, and brand-specific voice guidelines will be created during the `/strategy:voice` synthesis process, which will reference this research as its evidence base.

**This report documents WHAT IS (findings), not WHAT SHOULD BE (strategy).**
