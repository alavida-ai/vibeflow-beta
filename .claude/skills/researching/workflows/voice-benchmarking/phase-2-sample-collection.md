# Phase 2: Voice Sample Collection

## Objective

Collect representative voice samples from selected brands across multiple channels to enable comprehensive voice analysis.

---

## Context Required

You will receive:
- Brand list with selection rationale from Phase 1
- Business context (optional)

---

## Research Activities

### 1. Sample Collection Strategy

For each brand in the list:
- Identify 3-4 key channels where the brand communicates (website, social media, email, blog, etc.)
- Aim for 5-10 total samples per brand across different contexts
- Prioritize variety over volume

### 2. Channel-Specific Collection

**Website Copy:**
- Homepage hero text and taglines
- Product/service descriptions
- About page narrative
- Value proposition statements

**Social Media:**
- Recent posts across platforms (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Focus on brand-authored content (not user-generated)
- Include both long-form and short-form posts

**Email/Newsletter:**
- Welcome emails
- Product announcements
- Newsletter content
- Transactional email copy

**Blog/Content:**
- Blog post excerpts (introductions, conclusions)
- Case study narratives
- Help documentation tone

### 3. Sample Documentation

For each sample, document:
- **Brand name**
- **Channel** (website, Twitter, email, etc.)
- **Context** (homepage hero, product announcement, newsletter, etc.)
- **Full text** of the sample
- **URL/source** (if available)
- **Date** (if relevant)

### 4. Organization

Organize samples by brand, with channel groupings within each brand:

```
Brand A
  └─ Website
     └─ [samples]
  └─ Social Media
     └─ [samples]
  └─ Email
     └─ [samples]

Brand B
  └─ [same structure]
```

## Research Tools

Use web scraping and search capabilities:
- Visit brand websites directly
- Search social media profiles
- Use web archive for historical samples if needed
- Review brand content across multiple touchpoints

---

## Deliverable

Create a comprehensive artifact containing:
- Organized voice samples for each brand
- Context and source information for each sample
- Channel distribution summary (e.g., "8 samples from Brand A: 3 website, 3 social, 2 email")

**Format:** Markdown document with clear brand/channel hierarchy

## Quality Checks

Before completing this phase:
- [ ] Collected 5-10 samples per brand
- [ ] Samples span at least 3 different channels per brand
- [ ] Each sample includes context and source
- [ ] Samples represent different communication contexts (not all the same type)
- [ ] All brands from Phase 1 are represented equally
