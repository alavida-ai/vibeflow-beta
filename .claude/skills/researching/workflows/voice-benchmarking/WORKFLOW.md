# Research Voice Benchmarking

Analyze brand voices from admired companies to identify voice patterns, tone characteristics, and communication principles that could inform your brand voice strategy.

---

## Research Objective

**Goal:** Deconstruct successful brand voices to understand voice attributes, patterns, and principles that resonate with target audiences.

**Inputs:**
- List of 3-5 brands with voices you admire (can be in your category or adjacent) - **User provides this**
- Target audience definition from customer insights (if available)
- Brand story (if available)

**Output:**
- Published research report with voice attribute analysis, pattern identification, and observed voice principles (unopinionated findings)

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Brand Selection

**Purpose:** Gather user input on which brands to analyze.

**Activities:**
- Ask user for 3-5 brands whose voice they admire (can be in category or adjacent)
- For each brand, ask: "Why do you admire this brand's voice?"
- Confirm selection and capture selection rationale
- Document brand list with user's rationale

**Phase output:** Brand list with rationale

### Phase 2: Voice Sample Collection

**Purpose:** Collect representative voice samples from selected brands.

**Instructions:** [phase-2-sample-collection.md](phase-2-sample-collection.md)

**Context needed:**
- Brand list from Phase 1
- Business context (optional)

**Research activities:**
- Collect voice samples across channels (website copy, social media posts, emails, blog posts)
- Gather 5-10 samples per brand across different contexts
- Organize samples by brand and channel
- Note context for each sample (homepage, product page, social post, etc.)

**Phase output:** Voice sample collection organized by brand

### Phase 3: Voice Attribute Analysis

**Purpose:** Deconstruct each brand's voice into specific attributes and patterns.

**DELEGATE to analyst-agent**

**Instructions:** [phase-3-voice-analysis.md](phase-3-voice-analysis.md)

**Context needed:**
- Voice samples from Phase 2

**Research activities:**
- Identify voice attributes for each brand (e.g., conversational, authoritative, playful, irreverent)
- Analyze tone spectrum (formal ↔ casual, serious ↔ humorous, respectful ↔ irreverent)
- Extract writing principles and patterns
- Document vocabulary and language choices
- Identify sentence structure and rhythm patterns
- Note distinctive voice elements (humor, metaphors, storytelling, directness)

**Phase output:** Voice attribute analysis per brand

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Brand Pattern Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify common patterns and differentiation strategies across benchmark brands.

**DELEGATE to analyst-agent**

**Instructions:** [phase-4-pattern-analysis.md](phase-4-pattern-analysis.md)

**Context needed:**
- Voice attribute analysis from Phase 3

**Research activities:**
- Compare voice attributes across brands
- Identify common patterns in successful voices
- Document differentiation strategies
- Analyze channel-specific voice adaptations
- Identify voice principles that resonate with target audiences
- Note what makes each voice distinctive

**Phase output:** Cross-brand pattern analysis

**Note:** Phases 3 and 4 can be executed iteratively if needed.

### Phase 5: Research Report Generation

**Purpose:** Synthesize all findings into final research report.

**DELEGATE to analyst-agent**

**Instructions:** [phase-5-report-generation.md](phase-5-report-generation.md)

**Context needed:**
- All artifacts from previous phases

**Research activities:**
- Synthesize voice attribute patterns across all analyzed brands
- Document tone spectrum observations from benchmarks
- Extract writing principles observed in successful voices
- Compile common voice differentiation strategies observed
- Document channel-specific voice adaptations observed
- Create voice elements inventory (do's and don'ts) based on analysis
- Write comprehensive research report using template

**Report structure:**
1. **Benchmark Brand Profiles** - Overview of analyzed brands and why they were selected (from user input)
2. **Voice Attribute Analysis** - Detailed breakdown of each brand's voice characteristics (findings)
3. **Common Patterns** - Voice principles observed across benchmarks (findings)
4. **Differentiation Strategies** - How brands create distinctive voices (observed patterns)
5. **Tone Spectrum Analysis** - Where each brand sits on tone dimensions (findings)
6. **Writing Principles Observed** - Patterns extracted from successful voices (findings)
7. **Channel Adaptations** - How voice adapts across different platforms (observed patterns)
8. **Voice Elements Inventory** - Documented do's/don'ts from analyzed brands (findings)

**Template:** [templates/voice-benchmarking-output.md](templates/voice-benchmarking-output.md)

**Phase output:** Final research report

**Note:** This phase presents FINDINGS, not recommendations. Strategic voice recommendations happen during strategy synthesis (`/strategy:voice`).
