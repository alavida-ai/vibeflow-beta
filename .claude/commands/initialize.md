# Initialize Agentic Marketing Architectre repository

## Purpose

You must initialize the repository so it is consistent with the file structure of the AMA Methodology

## Instructions
- You will ask a few very concise and simple questions to the user, asking what `brand` this repo will represent. 
- Create the following folders: 
    - `/strategy`
    - `/research`
    - `/content`

- Update the README.md to reflect that this represents the repo of the brand which utilises AMA. The README.md should be very concise and should reference https://marketingarchitect.ai/ and https://marketingarchitect.ai/mcp as the documentation that outlines the AMA methodology. 
- Add a single line reference at the top of Claude.md which references that agents in this repo are employees of the agency managing the `brand`
