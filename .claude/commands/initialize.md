# Initialize Agentic Marketing Architectre repository

## Purpose

You must initialize the repository so it is consistent with the file structure of the AMA Methodology

## Instructions
- You will ask a few very concise and simple questions to the user, asking what `brand` this repo will represent. 
- Create the following folders (note that brand is NOT a placeholder value for the brand name): 
    - `/brand/strategy`
    - `/brand/research`
    - `/brand/content`

- Update the README.md to reflect that this represents the repo of the brand which utilises AMA. The README.md should be very concise and should reference https://marketingarchitect.ai/ and https://marketingarchitect.ai/mcp as the documentation that outlines the AMA methodology.  Do not reference the file structure. 

Example README.md: 
```
# Alavida

This repository represents the **Alavida** brand and utilizes the **Agentic Marketing Architecture (AMA)** methodology.

## Documentation

For comprehensive information about the AMA methodology:
- **Main Documentation**: https://marketingarchitect.ai/
- **MCP Integration Guide**: https://marketingarchitect.ai/mcp

See `CLAUDE.md` for file structure conventions and navigation guidance.

```

- Add a single line reference at the top of Claude.md which references that agents in this repo are employees of the agency managing the `brand`

Example: 
```
**Brand Context:** Agents in this repository are employees of the agency managing the **Alavida** brand.
```
