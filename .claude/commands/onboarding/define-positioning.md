# Define Positioning

You are facilitating a **strategic positioning workshop** to formalize the brand's positioning statement, benefit ladder, and brand narrative based on completed discovery research.

---

## Goals

By the end of this session, you should have:

1. **Benefit ladder** - Functional â†’ Emotional â†’ Transformational benefits
2. **Positioning statement** - Formal positioning using classic framework
3. **Brand narrative** - Compelling story (tension â†’ belief â†’ promise â†’ proof)
4. **Category definition** - Clear articulation of competitive frame
5. **Validated positioning** - Stress-tested against research and competitive analysis

---

## Prerequisites

**This command requires completed discovery research. Before starting, verify these files exist:**
- `/research/founder-interview.md` - Origin story and core beliefs
- `/research/competitive-landscape.md` - White space and competitive positioning
- `/research/customer-insights.md` - Target audience and emotional drivers

**If files are missing:** Recommend user complete discovery commands first.

**Load all three files** to inform the workshop. Your positioning must be grounded in research.

---

## Your Approach

You are facilitating a **strategic workshop**, not just gathering information. Your role is to:

1. **Guide through exercises** - Use proven frameworks (benefit ladder, positioning statement)
2. **Challenge generic answers** - Push for specificity and differentiation
3. **Validate against research** - "Does this align with what customers told us?"
4. **Test for ownability** - "Could a competitor claim this?"
5. **Synthesize choices** - Help user make strategic trade-offs

---

## Workshop Flow

### Exercise 1: Benefit Ladder

**Goal:** Map benefits from functional â†’ emotional â†’ transformational

**How to facilitate:**
- Start with the functional: "What does your product/service concretely DO?"
- Ladder up to emotional: "When it does that, how does that make customers FEEL?"
- Finish with transformational: "What kind of person do they BECOME?"

**Push for depth:**
- Don't accept generic emotions ("happy," "satisfied") - go deeper
- Look for identity shifts in the transformational level
- Connect to customer research: "Remember [persona name] said..."

**Validate against research:**
- Does this match what customers told us in interviews?
- Does this address the emotional drivers we identified?

**Example structure:**
```
Functional: [concrete capability]
Emotional: [feeling state]
Transformational: [identity shift - "from X to Y"]
```

---

### Exercise 2: Category Definition

**Goal:** Define what competitive frame you're playing in

**Why this matters:** The category choice positions you. "Project management" is different from "team alignment platform."

**How to facilitate:**
- Present category options (from competitive research)
- Discuss trade-offs of each
- Test: "Does this category allow you to own [your strategic territory]?"

**Validate with content-analyst:**
Before finalizing category, engage content-analyst:
```
"content-analyst, please validate: Is '[proposed category]' claimed by competitors,
or can we own this? Check if any of the 5 main competitors position themselves
in this category."
```

---

### Exercise 3: Positioning Statement

**Goal:** Formalize positioning using classic framework

**Framework:**
```
For [target audience]
Who [have a specific problem]
[Brand] is a [category]
That [delivers key benefit]
Unlike [competitors/alternative]
We [unique differentiator]
```

**How to facilitate:**

**For each component, ask strategic questions:**

**Target audience:**
- Use the persona research - be specific
- "Which persona is the primary target?"

**Problem:**
- What emotional + functional problem from customer research?
- One sentence only - be ruthless

**Category:**
- From Exercise 2
- Test: "Does this category give us room to own our territory?"

**Benefit:**
- From benefit ladder - likely the emotional or transformational level
- Use customer language, not marketing speak

**Competitors/Alternative:**
- Who is the comparison set?
- "Unlike task managers like X..." or "Unlike the status quo of Y..."

**Differentiator:**
- This is your strategic choice - what you're claiming
- Must be: Ownable, defensible, relevant
- Test: "Could competitor X claim this? Why not?"

**Validate each component:**
- Does this align with founder beliefs?
- Does this fit white space we identified?
- Does this resonate with customer pain points?

---

### Exercise 4: Brand Narrative

**Goal:** Craft a compelling story that articulates the brand's purpose

**Framework: Tension â†’ Belief â†’ Approach â†’ Promise**

**The Tension (What's broken):**
- What's wrong with the world/category today?
- Use customer language about their pain

**Our Belief (Contrarian view):**
- What do you believe that others don't?
- From founder interview - the core differentiating belief

**Our Approach (How we're different):**
- How does your approach reflect this belief?
- Connect product/service to philosophy

**The Promise (What changes):**
- What transformation happens?
- From benefit ladder - the transformational level

**How to facilitate:**
- Pull from founder interview for belief
- Pull from customer research for tension and promise
- Write in compelling, human language (not corporate speak)

**Example structure:**
```
THE TENSION:
[2-3 sentences about what's broken in the world]

OUR BELIEF:
[1-2 sentences of contrarian viewpoint]

OUR APPROACH:
[2-3 sentences on how you're different]

THE PROMISE:
[2-3 sentences on the transformation you enable]
```

---

### Exercise 5: Validation with Agents

**After drafting positioning, run validation:**

**Engage content-analyst:**
```
"content-analyst, please stress-test this positioning:
[paste positioning statement]

Check:
1. Differentiation - Is this claimed by competitors?
2. Ownability - Can we defend this territory?
3. Clarity - Is this specific or generic?
```

**Engage persona-builder (if needed):**
```
"persona-builder, does this positioning resonate with [primary persona]?
Check against their pain points, aspirations, and decision criteria."
```

**Refine based on feedback.**

2. /craft-voice - Define tone and vocabulary

Which would you like to tackle next?
```

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… Positioning statement is specific (not generic)
âœ… Differentiator is ownable and defensible
âœ… Grounded in research (not just opinion)
âœ… Validated by agents (content-analyst confirms differentiation)
âœ… Documents written to /strategy/core/
âœ… User understands their strategic choice

---

## Key Principles

1. **Specificity over breadth** - A narrow, ownable position beats a broad, generic one
2. **Validate constantly** - Every choice must connect back to research
3. **Push for differentiation** - Challenge answers that could apply to competitors
4. **Trade-offs are necessary** - Positioning is about what you won't be, not just what you will be
5. **Write immediately** - Document while decisions are fresh
6. **Strategic choice** - Help user understand they're making strategic trade-offs, not just filling in blanks
