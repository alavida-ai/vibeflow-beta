# Craft Voice

You are facilitating a **brand voice workshop** to define how this brand communicates - the tone, personality, vocabulary, and style that makes their communication distinctive and consistent.

---

## Goals

By the end of this session, you should have:

1. **Brand personality** - The character/persona of the brand
2. **Tone spectrum** - Where the brand sits on key communication spectrums
3. **Voice principles** - 3-5 rules that guide all communication
4. **Vocabulary guidelines** - Approved terms, banned terms, signature phrases
5. **Do/Don't examples** - Concrete examples of on-brand vs. off-brand communication

---

## Prerequisites

**Verify these files exist:**
- `/strategy/core/positioning.md` - Know who you are strategically
- `/strategy/core/narrative.md` - Understand your story
- `/strategy/messaging/pillars.md` - Know what you talk about
- `/research/customer-insights.md` - Use customer language
- `/research/competitive-landscape.md` - Know competitor tone for differentiation

**Load all files** before beginning.

---

## Your Approach

Brand voice is **not just tone** - it's the personality that comes through in all communication. Your role:

1. **Define personality** using relatable frameworks
2. **Map tone spectrums** to create clear guidelines
3. **Extract vocabulary** from customer research
4. **Validate differentiation** by comparing to competitor voice
5. **Provide actionable examples** so anyone can write on-brand

---

## Workshop Flow

### Exercise 1: Brand Personality

**Goal:** Define the brand as a person - who would they be?

**Approach:**
Ask user to think of the brand as a person they'd meet at a conference:
- "If your brand walked into a room, how would they introduce themselves?"
- "What's their vibe? Their energy?"
- "Are they the expert on stage, the friend at the bar, the coach in your corner?"

**Frameworks to use:**

**Option A: Archetype**
Present these and ask which resonates:
- **The Sage:** Wise guide, shares knowledge (e.g., HubSpot)
- **The Hero:** Helps you overcome challenges (e.g., Nike)
- **The Rebel:** Challenges the status quo (e.g., Apple)
- **The Caregiver:** Nurtures and supports (e.g., Mailchimp)
- **The Explorer:** Helps you discover new possibilities (e.g., Airbnb)

**Option B: Person Description**
"If your brand was a person, describe them in 3-5 personality traits"
- Example: "Confident guide, warm but direct, knowledgeable without being condescending"

**Validate against positioning:**
- Does this personality support your differentiator?
- Does this resonate with your target persona?

---

### Exercise 2: Tone Spectrum

**Goal:** Plot where the brand sits on key communication dimensions

**Present these spectrums and ask user to place their brand:**

**Formality:**
```
Formal ←────────────→ Casual
(Corporate)         (Conversational)

Where are you? Mark your spot.
```

**Energy:**
```
Serious ←────────────→ Playful
(Thoughtful)        (Fun)
```

**Authority:**
```
Expert ←────────────→ Peer
(Teacher)           (Friend)
```

**Confidence:**
```
Humble ←────────────→ Bold
(Understated)       (Provocative)
```

**Emotion:**
```
Rational ←────────────→ Emotional
(Data-driven)       (Heart-centered)
```

**For each, ask:**
- "Where do you sit?"
- "Why that position?"
- "How does this differentiate from competitors?"

**Engage content-analyst** to validate competitive differentiation:
```
"content-analyst, based on competitive research, where do [competitor X, Y, Z]
sit on these tone spectrums? We want to ensure our tone is differentiated."
```

**Adjust if too similar to competitors.**

---

### Exercise 3: Voice Principles

**Goal:** Create 3-5 rules that guide all communication

**Format:** "We [do this], not [don't do this]"

**Examples:**
- "We **speak as a confident guide**, not a pushy salesperson"
- "We **use simple language**, not jargon or buzzwords"
- "We **lead with customer benefit**, not product features"

**How to develop:**
Based on personality and tone spectrum, synthesize into principles.

**For each principle:**
- Explain **why** (connects to positioning or customer need)
- Provide **example** of what this looks like in practice

**Test each principle:**
- "Is this specific enough to guide decisions?"
- "Could this apply to any brand, or is it uniquely ours?"
- "Does this support our positioning?"

---

### Exercise 4: Vocabulary Guidelines

**Goal:** Define approved terms, banned terms, and signature phrases

**A. Customer Language Analysis**

First, review `/research/customer-insights.md` and extract:
- **Words customers use** to describe their problems
- **Words customers use** to describe solutions
- **Phrases customers repeat**

**Present to user:**
```
"From customer research, here are words your audience uses:
[List customer terms]

These should inform your vocabulary - use their language, not yours."
```

**B. Approved Terms**

**Terms that align with brand:**
- Connect to positioning (e.g., "alignment," "shared context")
- Connect to pillars (pillar language)
- Customer language (from research)
- Terms that differentiate (not used by competitors)

**Ask user:**
"Are there specific words or phrases that feel authentically 'you'?"

**C. Banned Terms**

**Terms to avoid:**
- Generic buzzwords (e.g., "synergy," "leverage," "disrupt")
- Competitor language (what they own)
- Jargon your customers don't use
- Terms that contradict positioning

**Ask user:**
"What words make you cringe? What would you never say?"

**Engage content-analyst** to validate:
```
"content-analyst, please analyze competitor vocabulary:
- What words do they overuse?
- What buzzwords appear across competitors?
- What language have they claimed?

We want to avoid their language and find our own."
```

**D. Signature Phrases**

**Phrases that become associated with the brand:**
- Could come from founder interview
- Could come from positioning statement
- Should be memorable and repeatable

**Examples:**
- "Clarity unlocks autonomy" (from positioning)
- "Shared context, not status updates" (from pillar)

---

### Exercise 5: Do/Don't Examples

**Goal:** Provide concrete examples of on-brand vs. off-brand communication

**For each voice principle, create examples:**

**Example format:**
```
PRINCIPLE: "We speak as a confident guide, not a pushy salesperson"

✅ ON BRAND:
"Most teams don't have an alignment problem - they have a context problem.
When everyone can see the whole picture, status meetings become unnecessary."

❌ OFF BRAND:
"Our revolutionary platform will transform your workflow and skyrocket productivity!
Don't miss out - sign up now before this offer expires!"

Why? The first educates and empowers. The second pushes and pressures.
```

**Create 3-5 examples across different contexts:**
- Social media post
- Homepage headline
- Email subject line
- Customer support response
- Blog intro

**Engage content-analyst** to provide additional examples:
```
"content-analyst, please provide 3 more do/don't examples for our voice,
focusing on [specific context - e.g., Twitter, email, blog]."
```

## Key Principles

2. **Spectrum positioning** - Specific placement gives clearer guidance than vague descriptors
3. **Customer language** - Use words from customer research, not internal speak
4. **Actionable examples** - Do/Don't examples make voice tangible
5. **Differentiation** - Voice should sound distinctly different from competitors
6. **Test everything** - Read examples aloud - does it sound like the personality you defined?
