## Research Objectives

### Hypotheses to Validate

**1. Territory Hypothesis: "Marketing Architecture"**
- Is "Marketing Architect" positioning territory claimed or white space?
- What language do competitors use for similar concepts?

**2. Strategic Tensions:**
- **Empowerment vs. Ease** → Do competitors position on "easy button"?
- **Own vs. Rent** → Do competitors push SaaS lock-in?
- **Enhance vs. Replace** → Do competitors position AI as replacement?
- **Elite vs. Mass** → Do competitors target "all marketers"?

**3. Enemy Hypothesis: "AI Slop"**
- Do competitors address content quality/authenticity concerns?
