Alexander: I brought you with stuff yesterday because I remember you saying you wanted to show some sort of like kind of infrastructure you're working on, right? The architecture for your, so I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll let you decide how you want to go about it. Do you want to show me what you're working on based on what you were telling me on, on, on Monday, or should I ask you the questions and kind

William: of

Alexander: issues I ran into yesterday? Let's start with the issues you ran into. Let's see how that kind of runs into what I was, what I was basically building or I'm building. Okay. Uh, so let me write them down here. I got them. Okay. So perplexity worked well when I added it in, um, two, two big things. One is actually a screenshot. I think I have to find it. I had to my, my, my desktop. Basically, remember when we said the guideline, LLM guidelines, we don't know if there were, we're assuming that they were, were running or not. It looks like they, it looks like it was still running under the old guidelines. Okay. Got you. That was, that was, and I don't know if it was running because it never stated. Um, hold on, let me just see if I have a, I

William: think it just

Alexander: felt like it was, right? No, no. Like it, it, it was like, here, let me, let me see this in Slack. This is, this is, I'll send you a screenshot. I snipped it. So, to show you, uh, it should be, uh, uh, just upload a Slack. So the, this is, this is what kind of got me to be like, okay, it's not running this guy. So it goes LLM guidelines. Right. But these are, these were the original guidelines. And I, and I marked that as false. Right. Right. And then, and then it looks like it's still looking at these, but it, it gave no observation or acknowledgement of the other guidelines. And then went to another, you know, fall crawl, random fall crawl tool again. Okay. Can, uh, can you open up your, uh, share your screen?

William: The cursor?

Alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me see. Because basically if you say false, that all it's saying is that it doesn't always apply it, but cursor still sees the rule and has the opportunity to decide if it wants to read it or not. Okay. So what you're saying false to here is just like, don't always apply it, but cursor is still going to see a list of rules and it's going to look at the description and be like, these are the LLM rules to always follow when, uh, working on the client. So if you put that, it's going to trigger the rule and be like, okay, what are you going to do it? So, I mean, the, the way to get around that is just to delete it. If you're not using it. I didn't want,

William: I

Alexander: didn't want to use that rule. Um, well, I mean, here this use our internal RPC pattern. Do I need this or can I add this on to the other one? Market persona persona. Use our internal RPC pattern when defining services. Always use snake case with service names at service template. What are you using this for?

William: You

Alexander: sent me this. Okay. Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. But I think this is, I gave you, this might've just been an example one. I think we don't really need these

William: rules at all.

Alexander: Because this is more for developers, I imagine, right? Yeah. Just basically reading this. Yeah. Okay. So I can just delete this. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So this right here, I put always apply true. Cool. Okay. So that's always going to apply the rule. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's, that's, so we're, we're, we're under the assumption that like, we're, we're, we're confident that it's using this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as

William: you can see,

Alexander: like, uh, if you just test it if you want. I mean, but I mean, usually what I do is like, just do a, put like a few tests, like examples in the rule or something that I just tested really quickly. But yeah, we'd be pretty confident that Chris is using it every time. Why do you feel like it's not? I honestly, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Like I, that, that, that's why I want to like either verify it or not because I, it could, but it's not giving me any sort of strong indication that it is either. Right. It's like, I just don't know. That's, that's one thing. Gotcha. Okay. So, so that's, that's the, and then one was, oh, okay. So I was messing around. Okay. So for example, I, I was, so I use sonnet and then I, I put the same prompt and I was using grok or grok. Is it pronounced grok? Is that how they pronounce it? Yeah. Grok. Grok, grok four. And I actually got a better even response than grok four. Right. Right. Or, or, or maybe, okay. But better may, may not be the best word. It was different. It was different. And it had some more insights. The, the, the, the, the sonnet one was still good. So I don't want to say it was better. It was just different, but it had some certain more insights. And then I was going to be like, okay, well, what, what about Gemini 2 .5? Right. Because I've been using that a lot just for advocacy stuff. I really liked it as a, I like that one a lot. Um, and then I stopped and this is why I stopped, which leads me to my, my other problem. My last problem was that it started, and I think we had that issue when we were, we were doing this together. It started to read my other MD files for a copy.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Right.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: And then, and then it's like that, and obviously like, that's not what we want to do because that is kind of the first point where we don't want to have any sort of reference files. Cause there won't be technically in your reference files. Right.

William: Sure. We're kind of

Alexander: doing the brand fundamentals from like, kind of like, this is kind of the Genesis part of this, of this activity or this workflow. Yeah. So it shouldn't have much information aside from obviously the context I give it, which is really maybe the website, maybe some documentation, maybe some client facing stuff, but nothing that's already been, let's say a brand fundamentals analysis, which it was doing right now. But you know, you see, so I was thinking of deleting it, but then I'm like, okay, well, is there a better way? Should I, should I give instructions or should I set some sort of parameters or as you put it guardrails so that it doesn't search for, for files that I'm not giving it explicitly. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, this was the exact issue that I was personally falling into, um, when I was working with this. So the issue was like, how do I break this down? I a hundred percent saw the power of having all of us in cursor. It was very clear to me. And then when you hook up MCPs and you bring in the custom workflows, the shit gets pretty crazy. But then as I mentioned, as I, as I repo, let's just call it the files started growing. I tried to my best to kind of structure it. So I have like a strategy file, then in a strategy file, I have Twitter strategy and all that kind of stuff. And I would kind of like write the prompt to be like, Hey, anything to do with Twitter, just put it in here. And I'd write rules and like in my rules, I put like a file structure to follow. And I was like, anytime you have something that is, uh, like related Twitter, then all the outputs from like the work that we do together on Twitter should be in the Twitter strategy file. And that worked, they actually worked quite well. And, and, and it kind of made it like scalable to the next round of kind of work that I was doing. And I was like, okay, sick, nice. Um, but then there was like also, so all sorts of issues that were falling into it. Right. So this kind of like file structure thing I was talking about, about when to reference file structure or not, like you can fix that quickly with rules, which is what we're going to do just to give you a better feeling for how the rules work and how it's listening to rules and that kind of stuff. So there's like randomly read files if it's completely unrelated. Um, but also like there comes a point where like, if you change the brand fundamentals file and that brand fundamental file is a dependency of your Twitter strategy. Do you get, do you get what I mean by that? Yeah. I do. You update your Twitter strategy, but then you change your brand fundamentals. Your Twitter strategy is invalid. Right. I, I, I, like even more, like sure brand fundamentals. For sure if it gets changed, there's one part of this before we even do the content generation. And that's like the con the content strategy, which takes brand fundamentals, buckets them into the content pillars, content formats and stuff. And then after that, so to your point, if that file content strategy file, which sometimes can, can change actually. Sure. Right. Yeah, it does. It does. It does. There, there are a lot of dependencies. I can see that could maybe mess up or confuse or I don't know. They, they, they, they complicate things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and like, it kind of forces when I was working, it forced me in this situation where I had to basically like over and over again, catch it. And it just get, you got, it became really annoying. Right. But it was still a better solution than just using Google docs and like my own file structure. So that's why I kind of started building out this, like kind of in, in house, like infrastructure that like, you know, allowed me to kind of structure the entire thing. So unless you have like other questions, I just like, I can kind of like intro it to you and show you how it kind of works. Um, if you're like, yeah, if you're interested pretty much. Yeah. I mean, like, so are you saying that you're the solution that you have or that you could tell you to show resolves? Yeah. This issue. Yeah. Cause I, I, I knew you'd fall into this issue cause I felt that issue. And, uh, um, but it was still, I still believe, and I think it is still the far superior way to approach this kind of problem that you and I talking about before. Um, which is like kind of you, you're developing these systems in place in order for you to, um, how do you say, uh, like create, like your marketing infrastructure. Right. And then you have like the operator model that we're talking about, like the architect model that we're talking about. So I, I was still confident that which was okay. Let's go move towards this. But so let me just show you. I did. Um, I'm just trying to get everything up for you. Uh, okay. Sick. This is perfect. Um, right. So what I did, and this is kind of like my first run of the solution. Should I show it to you? Um, can you see my screen? I was just lining up. Yep. Yeah. You see a shit ton of code, right? Yep. Okay. Cool. It's been my best friend for the last few weeks. Uh, so we're going to put all this away. Uh, so all that kind of matters is, is basically this folder structure. And you know how I told you, like you have to be like a, like a pain needed and you kind of like, uh, have like a file structure that kind of reflects your business strategy. So the way that I kind of approach this is like your file structure, you are able to do two things. So you can create the template for the output that you're looking for. Right. And then you can create the workflow that leads to that template. That's, that's pretty much the only things you can do. Okay. So this is where you're able to define like your really good prompts and update your problems and stuff. Um, and define like the, the way that they, how you say like the agent should answer and stuff like that. Sorry, go ahead. So is this workflow file accommodate, uh, like an accumulation of all the prompts that would guide the agent on how to complete the objective of creating the brand fundamentals, or let's say the phase one, which is brand fundamentals and maybe content strategy. And then you go to the content generation, which is phase two. Yeah. So, I mean, like essentially the way that I worked on this was a lot of like the marketers I have kind of, a lot of them worked like this pretty much where, especially when it came to support marketer did it. When you showed me over like the stuff on notion, you kind of sent me this, right? Like this idea of like phases in order to get to a brand document strategy. Right. So I was like, okay, so, you know, this is how a lot of the marketers work. And like, this is where like you create the prompt and the way that everything kind of flows is basically just a workflow at that point. So you basically just focus on defining these workflow files and you define the tools and you define the prompts that you want to use. Right. And then like, you basically just put it into the, a workflow .md file and you define what you want it to look like as the output. Right. So, I mean, there's still stuff that's missing. There's missing kind of like the, which we're going to add up for sure is the idea of like, you said that like the questions, you know, the kind of swipe files,

William: the brand

Alexander: ignition kit. Yeah. The brand ignition kit. So like that stuff I need to think about how it kind of develop all the solution. But I figured you'd get quite far if you just are able to define workflows and templates. But then we had the issue and of like essentially defining like how everything interlinks to each other. So the way I designed this, like, okay, if brand, if content strategy is a subfolder within brand fundamentals, then content strategy is dependency of brand fundamentals. So if I just show you over like this website here that I made, should be, let me just get this running. What basically this folder structure, which has competitor market analysis, content strategy, and tone of voice, all as dependencies of brand fundamentals, you essentially have like this kind of workflow where you have the workflow for brand fundamentals. You have the different outputs. I mean, I'm sorry. It's so chaotic right now. I don't know why it looks so fucking shitty, but I mean, this is just such a rough MVP, but essentially kind of gives you an idea of, of how everything kind of interlinks as depend on each other. Right. And by the way, this is all just in your file system. I'm like, and it's like just a way for you to visualize that I'm not actually making an app, but you kind of see like the workflow steps that are involved to get to that point. Uh, which is, should be here and the prompts that are being pulled in. Um,

William: What,

Alexander: what, what, what is this? So just I, what, what plot, is this connected to your cursor? Like that file, file structure of cursor, or do you have to like duplicate this and make this? No, no.

William: It's all,

Alexander: it's all interconnected. So I, I just wrote, I just wrote, this is my own website that I wrote just to visualize it. But basically if you change the file system here, it's going to reflect it here. Oh, cool. And you can see like what's been completed. And then you can just kind of climb and click on the templates in the output. But the whole idea is that it's all defined within cursor because you're able to pretty much just go into like your, your cursor and be like, okay, let's just trigger the next step of my workflow, which would just be like, right now I'm still implementing it. Like right now define like the next step, right? Okay. The next workflow we need to go through. I'm having an error I'm dealing with right now, but it'll, it'll define to you the next step. But I guess the interesting thing here is that if I changed like, uh, okay, this is my tone of voice document. If for whatever reason I change the tone of voice document, um, or I get rid of this workflow here that kind of like recompile the whole thing, it will kind of invalidate previous workflows and say, okay, well you've changed a brand fundamentals. So these two things are now stale. So you have to run through that kind of workflow together again. Okay. So let's, maybe we should be specific though, on like what changes for something to affect another dependency.

William: Right.

Alexander: Yeah. So, so like, for example, let's, let's like real world, let's see what, what actually would change brand fundamentals. Would it, brand fundamentals is super like, what do you have mission and vision? You have, let's say you have like the core offering. Now, mission and vision doesn't necessarily change too much. Really. I mean, when people pivot and stuff, businesses pivot, but really that's like low in the pecking order of things being changed. Core offering can change depending on just product offering. Right. So that, that could change. And Akave actually, that, this, this literally happened in the last six months. But that, that does, that can change. Especially nowadays when things get really like, you know, people start to like really be aggressive with their product offering, new changes, sometimes a lot of pivots, et cetera. What else? There's one thing to, on a segue of pivots, is that a lot of startups pivot to like, they think they're, they want to do X, but they end up realizing that Y is their need for their, that that's where their real market is.

William: Right. Yeah.

Alexander: Especially in a very fast pace, you know, now, like, you know, now that never, now that's a lot of, a lot of startups are like that. Um, so those, I would say those are the two main things that may have that change. Those changes are not weekly, obviously not daily, not even weekly, not even monthly. Right. I

William: would

Alexander: say like, maybe in a span of one quarter at the earliest, obviously there's always exceptions and then, um, could be six months to a year, if not longer,

William: you know?

Alexander: So, so the reason, so I'm just kind of outlining and just verbally saying this out loud, just so that we can think, okay, if those change, what, what are the, what's the contingency? Right. Then you've got, let's say, um, the content strategy. Okay. Actually there's two things here. Then, then you've got competitor analysis, which definitely will change based on competitors. Right. And if competitors, competitors have that same kind of like say, yeah, they will change. New competitors will come into play. Are, and, and is that a dependency? I think that like, for me, I always visualize the comp analysis. That's why I've been kind of spending a lot of time. Like what is, what makes up a good comp analysis? Right. There's kind of like two parts of that. There's like that qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis, right? Qualitative is understanding, you know, the offering and the messaging, the tone, the brand itself. And the qualitative analysis is more sort of quantitative analysis is more about how, what can you measure? Right. What are the quantifiable things that you can measure? Things like, let's say SEO web traffic, you know, SEM rush and Ahrefs, like all that stuff to understand what are the keywords? What are the articles? What are, you know, people are talking about like all those stats, like the, basically the numbers that can represent it. That's hard to scrape on LLM. Maybe there is, but there's also like software that you pay a lot of money just to get that information. I don't expect LLMs to get that information, at least a lot, a lot of it.

William: Right.

Alexander: Sure. The only LLM that I, that I saw that like, it was actually very, very good for what it could do was, was Grok 4 or Grok 3 actually, because you can actually get some pretty good stuff up. Like you pay a lot of money for listing tools that Grok actually did natively, which was amazing.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Sure. Anyways, I'm, I'm kind of digressing in details there, but what I'm saying is that comp analysis will change because for a few reasons, competitors change, they evolve. It's, it's, it's a free market and free market, right. To survive, you got to be the best or get better than your competition, et cetera. Right. So by that nature, things will evolve in pretty rapidly. Your comp analysis will rapidly evolve. Um, the cadence could be a month, could be a quarter, definitely a quarter. There's going to be new things happening. Definitely six months, one year for sure. Um, the other part of it is that you can have new competitors. Some, some competitors in your top five competitors you have to watch out for or listening to. You may drop off one or two and you can two enter the ring and they're actually now your top two. Right. So I'm saying all this because comp analysis does change. It's a living thing that you need to constantly be listening to. If you wouldn't really have the edge, a lot of people don't do it, but I'm talking if you want to stay the world -class, you know, way of approaching marketing. That does change. So that, that's a dependency on content strategy. So content strategy is obviously your brand fundamentals, uh, with these content formats and content buckets, and how you actually, when you communicate that all wrapped in with like your tone of voice, et cetera, your brand, your brand personality. And the other component is listening into what's trending, what's the conversation, what are, are in your niche articles, information that people want, what's higher ranking, et cetera. That's all evolving. Those are all dependencies, right?

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Both on the comp analysis and just general market it just, you know, like just the general, just, just the general way that people put out content in the conversation. It's a living, breathing thing. They're always going to be dependencies.

William: Sure. Right.

Alexander: So the, so the question is, is that, um, a lot of this, so really, if you really think about it, there's nothing, there's not really much that's really static. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I

William: mean, that's kind

Alexander: of the idea here though. Right. It's like, I'm trying to build a way that is firstly acknowledging how by marketing and marketing is moving and, and is completely bought into the, the thesis that marketers like yourself, who kind of learn that the competitive advantage comes from structuring and creating these systems and like really figure out the best workflow and like the best data that a different step might need, and all that kind of stuff would be incentivized to use tools like Tursor because it just, you know, 10 X is their output and use MCPs and all that kind of stuff where they, you know, you come to cutting edge, but then you fall into like this kind of thing where it's like, there isn't really a structured way to represent your kind of the internals of your strategy. Right. Right. Because when you initially gave the scope, right, there were like eight different workflows you gave me. And I broke, I kind of broke all of it down into like this big Excalibur, um, if I could try and find it somewhere, uh, around here. Yeah. Okay. I'm not gonna try to overwhelm you, but like just basically this is a technical thing, but essentially you have like your intelligence system, right? Which is going to be like the central pillar of everything. And in a very simple format, your intelligence system in my head should basically just be like a dynamic representation of your folders of your markdown files, which represent your strategy. Right. And I'm thinking like, how do you get to these markdown files? And we've already kind of agreed that like, and you can kind of see the power of, of creating these workflows that like are human in the loop. So you're sitting with the agent, the agent is triggering MCP tools for you. You're giving feedback. You're kind of saying, Oh, this competitor exists. Let's dive deeper. This competitor is research and compare all this kind of stuff. But then you want to like an artifact that reflects that kind of session you've had together. Right. And the artifact should be aligned with like your template. Right. And I, I'm kind of trying to see like, where does the, the, the, the skill shift towards. So I think the skill kind of shifts towards the ability of, as we discussed the other day, like to operate this system, to decide like what the template should have, what questions it should be answering, how the agent should approach it. And then like what data you kind of want to be getting, like you want to use fire crawl to scrape as a step. That's fine. Okay. You're scraping all the competitor websites, right? That kind of stuff. The thing is like, you don't want to be dealing with having to pay for like a fucking huge service to do all of it. So I was just trying to find a way that you just literally write that a markdown file, where you update the problem on top of the tools that each step uses, and you just define what it outputs, and then you just work with it with an agent. And then like, to like kind of like make sure that everything's dynamic, you have this workflow aspect here, which like if, let's, let's assume like there's like a third step, right? Like pretend like this was like this, right? So you had like a tone of voice and you had like Twitter tone of voice, for example. If tone of voice changes, which I think it can change because you might want to get like experimental the entire thing, your Twitter tone of voice is no longer valid. You have to rerun that workflow, right? Okay. So when you, okay, so this example of tone of voice, let's say there's some sort of tone of voice change that needs to be done, right? Or maybe there's a tweak in the brand personality that you want to experiment, like you're saying. Yeah. In my mind, it would be how I would approach it. And tell me if this is, if there's a better way or you think there's a different way to do it. Okay. So maybe I should start from the beginning. You got the human loop. So you got, you got, you've designed and architected the workflows and really in each stage you've architected really good prompts. Even you kind of identified which LLMs may be a little more stronger than others. Right. And then in each kind of process, again, the whole thing about Asian personas, right? Maybe the brand fundamentals persona. Right. And that markdown of persona is only for brand fundamentals. And then there's one for content strategy. Right. And that, right. Because, you know, it's kind of like you create these like specialized agents that do very specific things in the workflows. Right. Sure. And you define those. And then for each part of that, brand fundamentals content trend stuff, there's a file. One called brand fundamentals, one called content strategy, one called competitor analysis, you know, etc. And those files are like your documentation. Yeah. Right. Of like, you know, everything. Like pretty much like you can print this. I mean, it's marked down. I know it's not the prettiest to do it, but generally like you can structure that and then print it out. And like, that's like your Bible of like, this is my brand, you know, this is my brand. And this is my brand strategy, marketing strategies, etc. Yeah. So what gets changed? If for now going back to this, if tone of voice, we want to tweak it and we want to change some brand personality, I wouldn't rerun the prompt again. Okay. I mean, it really depends, but I wouldn't rerun the prompt. I would just tweak it in the actual document that's been finalized. So what do you mean by that? So you would, you wouldn't rerun the prompt, meaning you, if you have like, let's pretend this is Twitter tone of voice and this is tone of voice. Right. So you kind of like, you might have your strategy folder, like your tone of voice folder reflect like Twitter and like LinkedIn, where you have like slight variation of tone of voice across your platforms. Would you agree it's a situation that you might have? Okay. Well, yeah, I, like, I wouldn't say for Twitter and like tone of voice would be more like one document explaining. So you're, you're putting Twitter and LinkedIn because you think that they are, I get what you're saying. I know what you're saying. Tone of voice in this respect, I mean, more in terms of like how you want to communicate as a brand, like the language, the structure of the language, the emotional elements to that. Right. Like the brand personality and, and, and how you write to reflect that brand personality. Right. I think this is more in terms of like, kind of like, like channel formats or content formats. Right. Yeah. You write for Twitter a little bit different than LinkedIn, but the tone of voice, how you express yourself is actually the same. Interesting. Okay. Would you have an example of something that might have like a, like a two, like a two or three stream dependency, right? So you have like brand fundamentals, which feeds into total content strategy, which feeds into something else. Do you have an example of that? Maybe. Um, like for, for, for like, uh, like for, like what's your objective that you want to get? So I, I can give you a good example.

William: Um,

Alexander: so like where you'd have this kind of like three step, like, so this is like the brand fundamentals document, which like infers your tone of voice document, which infers like a, another document, which relies on the context of brand implementals and kind of voice or something like that. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. So you got brand fundamentals, then you've got the, um, the comp analysis is a bit different than you've got, let's say you've got content. I think it's content strategy and then tone of voice content strategy can be in different types of formats. The one I like to do is focus on, let's say group that the value propositions into something called, uh, uh, brand pillars, content pillars. And then in those, think of the content pillars as buckets, right.

William: Right.

Alexander: And then those, those content pillars, uh, um, are basically umbrellas for potentially many value propositions of that product offering in these buckets. Right.

William: Right.

Alexander: So you're kind of grouping them in that. And then you also now kind of map the audience motivators or behaviors. Right. That's why I don't necessarily like using demographic, like the demo to demographics, like signals brand personas and stuff. It's like, Hey, this is Jim. He likes to run. And you know, he has like those, those brand personas. I'm

William: not

Alexander: crazy about those because they really tell you nothing. Right. Like, like, like if you really don't get to nitty gritty, it's more about like, what do these people want? Why do they care? Why, why do they care about why your service and more about the emotional triggers, the psychological triggers and, and, and, and, and, and, and what makes them tick. So that gets bucketed in those, those pillars as well. Now that generates ideas for content. And then you have content formats of how do you, how do we wrap and angle those in, in many different ways per content pillar. Right. And this is a really extreme and good way to kind of create a workflow of like being very specific on the content and understanding like what type of content this is for, who it's for, and what's the main message for it.

William: Right.

Alexander: Sure. Um, now, now I'm saying all this so that if let's say a content pillar gets adjusted, so what gets actually refreshed now? It's the content.

William: Yeah. Yeah.

Alexander: It always comes down to really content.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: The content thing that gets refreshed because it's a dependency on the content strategy, which has those, has those content buckets. Right.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: And then now, if you were to go back one more, let's say you've got brand fundamentals and there's a change there. Well, it really depends on what the change is. So let's say if the change is mission and vision, at least it's like a drastic mission and vision change. Right. Like, Hey, like, you know, we're, we're, we're now, you know, we went from, let's say, you know, we went from like AI to, I dunno. I dunno. We went from like making masks for, for COVID versus now we're doing AI. That's a massive pivot.

William: Sure.

Alexander: And, and, and everything's changing because of that. That's a massive, but sometimes mission and vision changes slightly and it's not that big of a deal.

William: Right.

Alexander: It doesn't really change that much unless it's a massive pivot. Tone of voice, if it's a drastic change, because really you make a tone of voice document and the content strategy and the tone of voice work together. Because when you generate content, the content generation should first focus on, okay, what's the message? What's the angle? What am I focusing on in terms of the brand content pillar, et cetera. And then how do I now phrase that? What's my phrasing? And then that phrasing is using the tone of voice. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, when I'm trying to map out here, I mean, I mean, first of the main problem trying to solve is that when you're using Cursors MCP to do these human loop workflows, it's uploading the right files to the right places. Right. That's like the primary thing. So that only fetches in context of something you actually give a shit about. Right. So like, if you're working on this, on this note here, you don't want it to fetch some random, like other file that you've never, you don't really has nothing to do with it, which is what you were referencing before. So. Well, yeah, that, and the fact that it, well, yeah, I know what you're saying, but like, it was like, I was, I'm still at that Genesis part of brand. Fundamentals.

William: Right.

Alexander: Yeah. Yeah. And, and given that now, like, and I'm kind of just doing back tests and just, just, I'm just playing and experimenting. Right. Sure. Before I move on to the next one, I want to make sure brand fundamentals is good.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Like, like we did that Akave brand fundamentals on MD, like last week or so. This agent was smart enough to be, or at least let's say smart enough, self -aware enough to see that document, which I actually, you know, didn't realize that it was able to. Like, I guess. Maybe, maybe it would. Yeah. It's self -aware to understand, Hey, this is a document that I can use for

William: my

Alexander: objective. Yeah.

William: Despite

Alexander: me saying that, like, no, like that's, I want you to start fresh. But, but then again, the agent didn't know that. I didn't specify that too. Yeah.

William: Right.

Alexander: Yeah. So, so going back. So the question is, I guess, we're talking about a few things here. I suppose the main question is, and I think you, you, you respond in the beginning with it. And I'm not sure if there's another solution is do, do we need to create rules for each workflow so that, you know, we don't run into issues where it's, it's going beyond parameters that we don't want it to. Right. Yeah. I mean, there is like, yes, you would get the best output. You get the best performance if you create rules for each workflow. For sure. Right. But it doesn't mean necessarily that we have to, because you can just put that in prompt. Right. But I guess what, like the, the guardrails that I'm talking about is I'm trying to integrate, like I'm trying to create the actual guardrails through code to ensure that you focus almost all your energy only on. The workflow file. And the template file. Right. So you define the questions and the kind of output that you want. And you define kind of like how we get there and then nothing else really matters. Right. And so you're able to like fully leverage the power of this kind of cursor agent MCP. Um, like, uh, tooling that we have now. Right. And last. Just, just, just, just on that. Just right. It turned up to just so I can just tell me if I'm on the right track of, just to make sure that I'm not sending you. Are you saying that you want to like rules are one thing, but like, we have to, we have to maybe be very cautious of not creating rules where it doesn't give the agent. And whether it's freedom, the creative freedom or flexibility to solve the objective and not have the human element constraint it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I think like my job here and like, I want to use my engineering skills to kind of figure out how do I put as much of the emphasis on you to just focus on the workflow and like, and the prompting and the stuff that you're good at and like asking the right questions, which I think you could display in the workflow file and the template file. Right. And then not think about anything to do with rules or all this other bullshit. Cause that, all that kind of stuff, like I can generate myself with code as long as we just like agree on a file structure that you think would like accurately reflect your business strategy or your marketing strategy. Right. Because as per like the scope we have here, we need an intelligence system, which basically means that you kind of, as you mentioned, you need this Bible. Right. But you also mentioned the Bible is dynamic. Right. So it's going to change and you want to put the, the guardrails in place so that you don't have the ability to like fuck around too much and break things, but also have the flexibility to actually create like a fully optimized system where you as the marketer have a competitive advantage based on how good you make these prompts, how good and how much you think through the questions you want to answer. And like actually sitting with the agent and going through the human alert loop workflow and anything else you don't deal with. Right. That's, that's essentially what I'm solving here. And I'm like 95 % there. I was hoping to finish this afternoon, but I'm supposed to finish it tomorrow where you literally just define it in the file structure. And then you just go to the agent on the side and just be like, okay, uh, let's create brand fundamentals. And then it's going to go down the workflow with you. And then once you're happy that you're like, okay, let's create tone of voice. And then it's going to like tell the agent you have access to this brand fundamentals file. Check it if you need it. If not, here's the workflow. We're going to go down, follow these prompts here, here are the tools. So you don't need to mention anything about your tools because what's actually happening is this workflow file is being turned into like its own workflow file with like the tools that are associated to it. If that makes sense. So all that kind of shit that we were struggling with gets rid of, it gets rid of it pretty much. If that makes sense. Is it, is this workflow file just for brand fundamentals or does this represent the full workflow of all the categories? Just for brand

William: fundamentals.

Alexander: So you go one, you go down one by one. And then the only thing that you look at is just the output and you just read the output. So, so with the work, so if we were to create rules, I'm not saying we are not. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'm leaning to you to, to tell me if that, like, whatever the best approach is, if we were to create rules. So whatever the rules are. Yeah. Um, that would be in the, that would be expressed in the workflow file. Yeah.

William: I mean,

Alexander: the rules, I mean, there's, there's two types of rules, right? There's like some rules that were actually going to improve your life in terms of like defining how you wanted to respond that kind of stuff. Yeah. That you define the workflow files, but there's other rules, which are just like purely like guardrail rules, which you don't want to be dealing with whatsoever, which is like the kind of rule where it's like, you don't have access to the brand fundamental. Don't check this shit out. All that kind of stuff. Right. So we're trying to differentiate between those two types of rules here. One is like how to act

William: in the

Alexander: way that you like it. So you could, we call it personal. Let's just call it personality. Right. And then we have another rule, which is like functional rules. Like, what do you actually have access, like guardrail rules, which

William: I would.

Alexander: Yeah. Yeah. So I want to abstract away the guardrails and I want you to focus on personality template and workflow. So, so personality would have its own, like, kind of like what I did the MDC file. Yeah, exactly. So, so then, so then like in terms of like the properties of what goes into like, like the structure you'd have, let's say, I don't know, we call it a folder or whatever phase one brand fundamentals inside brand fundamentals. You have agent personality and you have workflow. And in workflow, you have, it, it, it expresses, okay, which tools to use, um, any guardrails. Yeah. To consider. Uh, what, what else is in that workflow file? So like, this is how the workflow file looks now. And by the way, this, the, the whole point is that like, you could make it dynamic as it's generated by AI, um, in the sense that you just focus on writing a markdown file that you agree with, which has different phases. I call it steps, right? You say the prompt that you use, you say like what you're expecting to get out of it and whatever. You don't even need to add this. That's completely fine. But then if you just associate with the template, like in the same folder, it's just going to go through these steps with you to generate that template. If that makes sense. So like, you remember how, like, I was like, Hey, okay, let's create brand fundamentals. And I want like literally like this and I call it pasted it in and then it triggered like the agent to kind of go down with it with me. And then that was a lot of the shit. Right. And then I was like, at the end of the session, I kind of like went back quite pasted this in. So, okay, now we're going to do digital press audit. Then we're good. Now we're going to do the market dynamics analysis, yada, yada, yada. And the end I had to be like, okay, I'll put this into my, uh, brand fundamentals folder. Right. That stuff. There's so much like room for human error. I believe personally. But if you just have the agent, like do all the work for you in the sense of like, it knows where it needs to put the file and knows what context to fetch just based off your file structure. And it knows what prompts to use just based off your workflow file and how you want to output it just based on your template file. That means you can focus your full energy on defining the, how you get there, defining what you want and then doing the human loop where I think that's where you really get the competitive advantage as your, um, as the marketer. Um, and I'm like very close to finishing this. This took fucking ages, but I'm very, I'm very close to having like a first version where you could just be like in the side. Uh, let's, let's do the comp analysis and it gives you all the guardrails and everything. So you don't have this crazy kind of folder structure. That's all broken. You have it like very cleanly represented like this pretty much. Um, and there's like a few other things I would do as well, which, uh, I mean, the whole thing was designed around the architecture that we kind of went over in the scope. Like the God version of a marketing, uh, pretty much. So, so the, the workflow doesn't have the prompts itself in it as well. Yeah. Yeah. So you have here like prompts to use, um, prompts to use for that step. So, so then how, how do you trigger it? You just like, like say, I want to create a brand, the brand fundamentals for this. And then it just goes to this workflow and it just read, it just basically does what the workflow instructs it to do. Yeah. It'll be, it'll be smart. It's smart enough to find all the workflows that you have in your, in your repo. Right. And it's actually also smart enough to find out which ones have already been done. So it'll be like, okay, you want to create tone of voice, um, in this session, let's say that you didn't make brand fundamentals yet, but you want to create a tone of voice strategy, but you know that you need brand fundamentals before you create tone of voice. Right. There's a dependency there. Then it's going to be like, okay, sure. But like, let's first go through the brand fundamentals workflow. Once that's

William: done,

Alexander: it outputs it. And then it's like, okay, now we're ready to do tone of voice. You're ready for tone of voice. Okay. Let's do tone of voice. And then it would go like that and it'll have automatically pull in or put the guardrail to make sure it only uses brand fundamentals as context. That's cool. Uh, that's cool. The one thing though, is that, and this kind of goes back to human in the loop, like going in that example, I want to create tone of voice, but I need brand fundamentals. I need X, Y, and Z. Right. You, you, you 100 % need to some level human in the loop and stakeholder in the loop for brand fundamentals. Right.

William: So,

Alexander: so it, it, it can, um, like you could technically do like what you're saying is thing. But like, for example, I'm, I'm in this right now where I'm like back testing brand fundamentals. I'm messing around with LLMs. Right. Yeah. I'm messing around with, okay, now can I adjust my prompt to add sources versus citations? And kind of, you know, how do I improve my prompt? What is the output that I like? And I'm thinking about like, okay, instead of me just like adjusting and doing now human of the loop, how can I actually, instead of me prompting, um, and going through this conversation of making it better. I'm more thinking about how can I now, instead of me actually saying, you know, this is not this way, or you should be doing this. How can I make my prompt better or not better, but maybe improved or optimized.

William: Right.

Alexander: Maybe in my, in my prompt, I'm having now like my own little rule set of like, don't do X, Y, and Z, or, you know, like, don't, don't say some sort of generic opaque claim. Maybe make it more specific to what it is, you know, no, don't, don't focus on any sort of generalizations, whatever it is. Right. Now, the reason why I'm doing that is that like, I, despite me knowing that there, there should be a human loop and there, there should always be. Right. That doesn't mean that I can't make the prompt as good as possible. So that, like I said, it gets to 80%. That's really good. And that's 20 % human loop. I get that to 85%. And that's 15 % human loop. Right. Or maybe 90%. It's, it's a testament of, of how well my prompt as you put this workflow documents. Right. Yeah. Um, so I like, I like, but they're always big, for example, I'm actually be testing it now with, with, uh, Crystal has, uh, uh, she, she told the, the, the, the founder of the, one of the co -founders of Akave. Cause like, the thing is, is this, this is kind of like a digression, what we're doing brand fundamentals and stuff. Like some marketers do it. I think the good ones do it. Um, a lot of them don't do it.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: You'd be surprised how many companies don't do this in the beginning. Right. They, they, and, and, and like, and we've, we've come in and we actually did this right when we started with them and they didn't really appreciate it. And we did it for our own purposes. Like we did it because like, this is how we approach it. This is the only way to get good content out. We have to understand what the brand is. Right. It makes no sense. People do marketing without understanding the brand all the time. It's ridiculous. Right. They only started to really appreciate this stuff like two, two months ago, where they started to really understand this concept of workshops and understanding. You get a lot more clarity about your business and how you communicate throughout the whole organization, marketing, sales, even business leadership and vision. Right. Have a sense of unity and cohesion of like, if you're working on something, it better contribute to, let's say the quarterly or yearly vision. Right. If not, it's a waste of time to

William: get that

Alexander: clarity. You need this workshop. You need these workshops. You need this on paper. You need this to be defined. Right. For us as marketers, it's really good to define because really marketing, like all marketing is, is content. If you want to boil it down to it's content,

William: right?

Alexander: Yeah. Marketing is content. It's, it's like, what type of formats are you communicating that, that content, right? It's communication in little packets, right? That could be in social media, tweets, articles, blogs. It could be in an AMA. It could be in a video. It could be in a small ad, whatever it is, but it's all content. We need to understand the brand brand personality and stuff to do that. Going back to this, there's going to be some elements where an LLM, as good as these LLMs are, they cannot hallucinate what the stakeholder co -founder's mission is or vision is, right? Or how it wants to come across as a brand personality. They can give some pretty good, let's say, answers, but they're just pretty good hallucinations, right? It could be completely against what the idea of the stakeholders want, right? Or, or, or leading towards. So there will always be, will be for brand fundamentals. Yeah, human the loop as a marketer to see, okay, can I present something that's really good? But also there's going to be questions that we just simply can't answer because we have to get that voice of client aspect of it. Sure. Competitor analysis. Yeah. And then that, that's a little bit more tangible, to be honest, because you can get that, you have to scrape that. That's all kind of more factual based. Content strategy is a moving living thing. So would I ever, and I know it's a good example to just open up the thinking of like, and I know what you were trying to illustrate that. Like you can get to like, you can ask it to go to step C, but it needs to understand, it needs to do step A if it's not done, or it needs to do step B. I get what you're saying. Yeah, that's interesting. Okay. So, so going back to this, what, what can I do? Okay. There's a few things. What can I do? Okay. Like, what can I do? Cause I need to actually get, cause I'm going to give one run of this brand fundamentals. We did this for a copy network, but this is for a copy club. Right. Yeah. And I told Crystal that like, okay, let them know that we're going to come up with something as a test. Right. Um, and then we'll give the brand fundamentals. And instead of me doing it the way I always do it, which is like, you know, spending a couple of hours in chat GPT or, you know, sonnet and kind of going through this. I wouldn't actually test it with this. Right.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: I don't expect it to be, well, I'm not saying I expect it to be perfect, but this is a good test to see. Can I get 80, 80%, like a good response with this new workflow? Can my human, the loop kind of like address issues that the LLMs will just won't be able to like address. Can we give it? And I'm curious to see how the stakeholders think about it and what their ranches are going to be about, like their feedback around that. I

William: think

Alexander: that's a very good real world. Um, kind of like, it would be a good experiment and the very timely one, given all the, like what we're doing right now. Yeah. I mean, I mean, given the, the, the time sensitivity, right? Like I kind of want to balance two things, right? Like I think you and I are aligned in the vision that you kind of want me to help you build essentially, which is like this, this full fledged system that kind of has a content intelligence system and allows you to trigger third party workflows and captures data and self optimize all that kind of stuff. That's great. Right. And like, this is what step one looks like. And I'm trying to do it the simplest way possible by having in your file structure system and you're using tools available like cursor, which I'm hopefully you're enjoying, but you can also see the limitations of it right now where we kind of need to build some customized stuff. So this is, this is kind of an example of that with that said, like in order to get something like today, right. If that's like the time pressure dealing with or like tomorrow.

William: Oh, no,

Alexander: no. Yeah. Just right. It doesn't be a time. Like I'm, what I plan to do is legit. Cause I already got like, again, that whole thing about adding perplexity into the prompt, uh, gave better answers. And then I got to a point where I was again, testing different LLMs. And like Grok 4 was like, actually, it was like very surprised if like, it gave me like a, a, a nice, it was good, but I'm like, well, let's see what Gemini, that's when it was like, oh fuck. Now it's like, it's now seeing all these other files. And I'm like, I don't want that. Right. Cause

William: now

Alexander: it's being influenced and biased and it's like, so that's why it's like, should I just put a, like, what do I do to solve that? Right. I think in terms of the immediate time sensitive thing, I know you're still designing this whole thing and that that's great.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: But for my own kind of like, cause I still want to play around and mess around and get a feel for it, which I can, I can come back to you and be like, okay, listen, I find that this LLM gives me a better response than this LLM for this part. Like brand fundamentals. Right. Yeah. So I would, which I think is like, those optimizations are, I think are very like, those are the things that I think are, are, are, are like small things, small little details like that. I think make, make a big impact that build up over time. Yeah. I agree with you. I agree with you. So, I mean, I kind of, I would just give you like a mental model to think of always start with a prompt. So you can even just say the prompt, don't use any other context in the, in the folder, because now you kind of have an understanding that cursor is able to see your entire file, entire file system, which it is. That's what makes it so powerful. It can see your entire file system. It could read files independently based on its thought process. Right. If it determines that brand fundamentals is important for what you're doing, then it was going to do it unless you prompt it not to. And the same with the rules. Right. Now, how do you differentiate between when to use a prompt or when to use a rule? I think cursor kind of gives you some pretty good, um, uh, kind of, um, best practices essentially, like in terms of when to use a rule and like, when's a good time to use a rule, but like essentially you should use a rule when you've abstracted a general rule that you want to use pretty much across entire workflows. Right. Now, what's interesting about rules is that you have like, there's like concept of like a nested rule, which is like, you'd actually apply a rule to a folder. Right. So like, let's make this actionable for yourself. If you were to create your brand fundamentals, I would literally just, let me just create an example folder. Um, right. I would literally just put like brand fundamentals in here. Uh, tools. And then like, as you mentioned, like the template on MD, which I think you already, you already have made. Right. And then I would, I would have your workflow file or with the prompts and stuff. And I would just go one by one, quite paste it. And I would just say like, uh, limit your context to brand fundamentals. Um, which one is it? This one. And that's going to like limit the entire context to this sub folder. So instead of going around deleting folders and stuff, literally just create a folder, put brand fundamentals, I put the template. It's only going to be able to look at your template. And then just say like,

William: sorry,

Alexander: this, sorry, this limit your context. Is this in the workflow file or this is, this is in the prompt? This could just be the prompt. This is when you work, when you're like triggering the session, just be like, Hey, you can only see this kind of shit pretty much. Okay. Right. And then, and then you just say like, at, then you put the folder and it's going to look at the template for my, for like the output that I want. Yeah. And it'll be smart enough to like output everything into brand fundamentals. Right. I guess a thing that confuses a lot of people, not confuses it, but scares a lot of people, which makes our life a bit harder as engineers is that like LMs are probabilistic. They're not deterministic, which means like I write code. That's a hundred percent of the time, same output. If you give it the same input, LMs have that like randomness to it, which kind of, scares people a little bit, but they're getting better. You know, you can just assume that they're going to get better. They're going to become more direct. They're going to understand things. But I think just be like explicit in your prompt. If there's something not going on, just fit, like do the prompt. Um, and then like what could also work is, is you can just do like a rule. So if you do like, um, uh, how do you say, what you can do is like you could limit like actual like rules to a folder, which is cool. So like personality .mdc. And then you can just like go like this. And then basically anytime it works within the brand fundamentals folder, it will apply that rule. If

William: that makes sense.

Alexander: Yeah.

William: Okay.

Alexander: So like you can check this out. Um, or like when it should use different rules and stuff like that. So this is what, this is kind of how you get like the personality based off of the different folders that it's working in. Why, why do you have to call it a .mdc file? Like, does it just know that this is a rule or like, this is like a, like,

William: why, why is

Alexander: it an MDC? It's because cursor creates its own fucking file extension to enable you to basically just have like this cool. Oh,

William: I see.

Alexander: Um, uh, thing in it. So you, you kind of just fix it. Um, so, so why, why, why can't you use social, what, what's stopping, okay. I guess, as I said, like what, what's stopping you to always name your files MDC and just have that feature if you need it or not, you can just use it if you need it or just. Well, I mean, cause it only applies to rules though, right? Like rules basically just adds like this metadata and it allows you

William: to like

Alexander: decide like when to kind of put it and just changes that metadata. It's all like, there'll be

William: no point

Alexander: to put in a template file because there's not like a concept to always allow or always read it or whatever. It doesn't really exist. Um, so, so, so then like for every single, if you, if we were to have rules and I know that we don't want to create too many rules, we don't want to constrict the LLM for having that kind of free range of thought and action. Is the best practice to have an MDC file per rule or

William: rule

Alexander: per MDC file? Uh, an MDC file defines the rule. So there's no rule without MDC file. Uh, yeah. But like, that's what I'm saying is that like, like then if, if you have like let's say five rules, instead of having it in let's say one folder, instead of having them in one file of all those five rules, have a folder in that folder called rules. It kind of like what you did just now and have every rule, a specific MDC file. And it's easy for you. It's more modular in the sense you can switch them on and off. Yeah. Yeah. And you can describe the, uh, the rule as well. So here's an example, uh, apply intelligence when agent decides is relevant based on description. Right. So you can give the description of the rule and be like, use this rule when we're working with brand fundamentals. Right. Or use this rule when we're working on content strategy, all that kind of stuff. And that'll define like how you want its outputs to be. And it'll define like the file structure. And like, if you're using a brand fundamentals, don't get context from anywhere else. Right. Um, another thing that I think will get you quite far as well, you should start experimenting with is you mentioned this concept of like, when you're dealing with brand fundamentals, especially you have like stakeholder input. Right. Like stakeholder in the loop. Yeah. Stakeholder in the loop. I'm not entirely sure how to get around that to be honest with you in terms of like having them actually be in the loop with you unless you're sitting down with them. No, no. Yeah. You wouldn't do it. But what you could do, do you have transcripts for the calls? Yeah,

William: yeah, yeah, yeah.

Alexander: So what you could do is literally just go like that and you just put the transcript file in there, like transcript .txt. And then you could just be like, you know, ensure that our brand fundamentals does not violate anything that was said in this transcript. And then you go like, then you go like data. And then that'll... Yeah. But this is, when I say like stay quote in the loop in this context, it's more about feedback after we give the brand fundamentals to

William: them. Gotcha.

Alexander: Gotcha. So you, you kind of like iteratively, iteratively. Yeah. Which, which is technically a human loop or, you know, which is fine. That, I mean, that like, there's no way around that, which, which like there shouldn't be. Right. Like, how can, like, it's going to be, it's very, very unlikely. You're going to always nail down a prompt or a workflow that's going to be so spot on where you got stakeholders all agree on it at the first thing. Like, that's literally impossible. Life doesn't even work that. You got stakeholders always arguing amongst each other of like what their thoughts are about their own business, about their own vision. Sure. So I do not expect an LLM to nail this down. That'd be like, this is like a God -like workflow.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: And you're able to kind of like see like, which is like, I'm not expecting that. So yeah, I, and this is why the human loop is always going to be very fundamental. I think even with like ASI, ASI is not going to even do that, to be honest. What's ASI? Uh, what is it? Uh, artificial super intelligence. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Because like, like, like people have biases, you have opinions, you have perspectives, right. And you're not going to nail it down in like one point of view. Uh, you might, but that's a very, that's a lottery ticket, you

William: know? Yeah.

Alexander: Well, what you probably realistically would do is have some sort of like update to your doctor based on feedback, right? You literally probably just reference your brand fundamentals, but like, Hey, just had this call with this guy. He didn't like this. He liked this. Yeah. Like this, whatever. Here's the transcript, update my strategy document to reflect that. And it'll just do it in front of you pretty much with like the right logic and all that kind of stuff. Yeah.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Yeah. Yeah.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Yeah.

William: There's ways to do

Alexander: that. There's ways to do that. Yeah. For sure. Okay. So, so action items on my end, I'll, um, so I can mess around with these rules or just put in the prompt, don't look, or I can either do two things. Put in my prompt, don't reference anything from my folder, or maybe just save those MD files and just delete them off the file structure. I was thinking of doing that yesterday, but I wanted to kind of consult and understand like why it's doing that. And, you know, before just, you know, just to talk, talk that through that. Okay. So that's one thing. Um, okay. So, okay. Twitter, uh, uh, Crystal asked me, um, we can do it tomorrow. Uh, she asked me about Twitter scraping. And I said that like, like, like I'm having, I'm going to be talking to you about comp analysis shortly soon this week. And, and that, that, that will definitely be part of that. So that could be tomorrow if you want to do like focus on comp analysis stuff. Cool. Um, but just to give you a heads up, like, like we're looking for an MCP, like a Twitter, uh, scraping one. Let me know if there's anything on, on my end I need to like get, whether it's like, do I need an amplifier? I used to have one. I can get one. I don't have one for my non -citizen email, so I can get that. Just let me know what resources I need to

William: get that.

Alexander: So I just need basically the profiles maybe might be an interesting one, um, of the comps or like actually not even the profiles. Just, are you expecting this great per, per profile or is it by trend or whatever?

William: Uh,

Alexander: it'd be per profile. Yeah. Okay. And you want all the tweets ever from the profile? Uh, no, I mean, I mean, I have to tie. I, I, I don't even know what the way would she want. She wouldn't look for something. I forget what she said about around that, but it was probably for comp analysis some her own way. It's not for this, but I'm sure like I'll, I'll need it for comp analysis because aside from scraping the websites, blogs, et cetera, of these, these competitors. It's about, you know, you get a lot of good information on their Twitter, right? I think a Twitter is a good representation of the brand, how they, how they communicate, what they focus on, what they actually emphasize, you know, how they present themselves. Right. Like for, for web3 specifically, when it's very Twitter heavy, it's, it's like, it's like 20%. It's like the 80, 20, right? You can get 80 % of a brand personality and a lot about the brand by just their Twitter alone. Forget even their website and blog stuff. Right. Obviously though, that's all good and it helps, but yeah, point I'm trying to make is that for the comp analysis, I spent a lot of time with this, like, like this, this past weekend thinking about what, what is, because there's so many ways people do comp analysis. Right. There's so many things you can do around that. Um, like what is like, like it's, it's about not, not doing everything, doing the most impactful, meaningful stuff. Right. Uh, and how, how it actually serves my goal, which is creating a really good content strategy and, and in some ways how to also create business insights. Right. That we can also give to the client. Right. Cause it's like, there's like, we're kind of like, we, we come in as not just like as marketer, marketing consultants or marketing advisors and obviously content creators and et cetera. We like to kind of like, also like marketing is, is very much in touch with the pulse of the business itself. Right.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: So since we have all these really good insights about voice of customer, how we should communicate yourselves as a brand, which is really a business objective marketing and the content formats. We also can extract those insights and create actually like good insights for business, which is business intelligence in general. Right. That we passed over to, to, to the stakeholder. And we're not saying, do this. We're saying, Hey, here's some insights we've got. This is something to consider. We make the client smarter or more, let's say intelligent. They appreciate it, appreciate us for that. And they also know that we're thinking on that level to help them. We're not here to just, Hey, we're here to help you with your marketing. We're really, we're here to help you with your business. Yeah. So, okay. Let's, um, the MCP tool that already made scrapes Twitter. Right. But it sounds like you want a little bit of analysis. Uh, No, that could be a different one that that that's a different set of. Okay. Analysis and what though? Twitter or the comp analysis? Twitter. Honestly, what you, what you had. I thought it was amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's great. Right. And like with the idea of having the transcripts and the videos and like the visual understanding. It

William: was

Alexander: incredible. It was amazing. I, I didn't even know you can even do what you do. Like the media thing. You can scrape Twitter. I didn't know you can do it that level the way that, what you made for the scraper thing. Yeah. I mean, even your EBS score was, I don't know how, how it is, but just to, I, I'm curious to dive deeper with it. But the EBS scores, but I know you scored it and you quantified it in some way,

William: right? The quality, which is.

Alexander: If you want

William: to, if you want to see

Alexander: how I calculate the EBS score, you'll be very disappointed. But, um, well, not disappointed. You'll just be like, Oh really? That's, that's fucking. Uh,

William: what is it?

Alexander: It's, it's literally just, I wait it. And I just take like an average of the waiting pretty much like bookmark is worth like double a retweet and a quote is worth like, you know. Okay. But, but, but this is like, are these metrics taken by how the algorithm, uh, the Twitter algorithm, um, cause I know for example, likes mean nothing. It's actually bookmarks mean a lot. Like you read in bookmarks. I see here bookmarks is heavy. Quote tweets, retweets, likes is the least. Yeah. I mean, that's generally what Twitter has been saying.

William: Right. It's a

Alexander: model. Right. And I, and like, I wasn't focusing on virality here. So I wasn't trying to align at a hundred percent of Twitter's one. I was trying to focus on like value to the individual. I think if someone bookmarks it, it means like it was a valuable tweet for them because my incentive was a bit different. Like I'm not looking for virality. I'm looking to find like a very loyal following pretty much who'd like my content and would actually find it valuable. So I was like scraping different profiles in my niche, like boring marketer and kind of do the analysis there. But we can also kind of do, right. Um, is this aspect of like exposing, um, like an analysis tool pretty much. So like, as I mentioned, like the ability to kind of take the top medium and like low level tweets in terms of EBS and like kind of like pulling all of them in into like Gemini or something, which has like a big context window and then performing the analysis at the back of that and giving you insights, like that's a pretty cool like workflow. Right. Yeah.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: I'm just thinking like, do I expose anything else? I mean, to be honest, what I'm exposing right now is like this, literally the database itself. And then I'm just, I'm relying on the MCP agent itself to kind of figure out the best, uh, query to pull the data in and actually read the data raw. Like there's no actual insights being generated from programmatically. It's all just chucking it into Gemini. Yeah. Which is, which is actually kind of what I'm working on is, is like that comp analysis prompt about like, how do you, like, it goes from like, like a prompt that structures like one competitor. The one thing I'm missing is, is the Twitter information. I don't know if that's like a separate thing that you gotta do, then it takes that information to, and part, as part of the prompt, like it's a contingency on, on that scraping tool. It makes another document. Maybe that's better because again, the whole thing about context windows is that they actually, this is a good question here. You do the comp analysis and the comp analysis for, for, for one competitor is only what's on the website or anything that's like blogs or whatever, just like, you know, front facing public stuff. The second part is Twitter. It scrapes Twitter. And then to your point, you have a comp analysis or content Twitter analysis, whatever you want to call it, that, that focuses on Twitter. And what does that really mean? It maybe starts to see patterns in terms of, again, what are those content pillars or content buckets, right? What is the tone of voice on Twitter? Again, your EVS score is some form of, of, of a scoring system. Um, what are they really emphasizing? What are the things that, um, what are the weaknesses or vulnerabilities? What could they do being better? What can us, the client or the client, what can they do to capitalize on those weaknesses? Right. Right. So like that kind of analysis and, and doing that, that type of thing, which really it's just how you approach the prompt at this point. Right. Yeah. It's how you approach the prompt is how you structure it. So like if we do like a, a Twitter specific, uh, strategy folder, for example, one of the steps within your workflow would be to trigger the MCP tool, which is our custom tool, or if it's a third party tool, we don't really give a shit, uh, what the analysis looks like. And you'd put that in the prompt and then how you kind of use it downstream throughout the rest of the workflow to generate that kind of strategy file. Or you just create like a, uh, your own kind of like a file, which is just purely the analysis from Twitter. So you can just drop it and send it to a client very quickly. And then you have like, I guess a downstream dependency, uh, your Twitter strategy file, which uses the insights and whether other workflow steps you kind of defined to get to that, to that file. And that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Which, which I think is kind of like, well, it'd be like workflow. Like, again, if, if context window is a thing you have to consider one for website, one for just a front facing stuff. Second workflow is now scraping your scraping tool. So in that prompt, it analyze. So you got two documents per competitor, right? Maybe there's more, right? But, but let's say those are the two main ones. Um, you do that. Let's see that five competitors. You do, you do that for five competitors, two documents for, for each competitor. You got 10 documents. And then you have another document that synthesizes all that stuff in a nice, clean way in another document. Obviously it's gonna be a bigger document, but that, that last document is your competitor analysis. True. Yeah. And, and the reason why, like, we have to kind of separate them in my view, correct me if I'm wrong. In different documents, one for website, maybe what's online versus just social proof for each one is purely because of context window. Context window. And you're going to get better output because.

William: Be better output. Yeah.

Alexander: Like I believe the, the concept of modularity, which is a huge concept in software engineering really applies to marketing as well. And at the prompts, right? Like if you go into a prompt session or a human loop session, or not even that, just writing a prompt with a very specific output is always going to perform better. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so I'm very mindful. Cause like, again, like to, like exactly what you're saying, if I did the opposite and said, here's my competitors scrape all this Twitter, scrape all X, Y, and Z in all in one prompt and did all that stuff. Yeah. Maybe it'd give you something, but maybe it'd be very surface level. Cause it's just too overwhelming for the other ones. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I'm super excited to, to, to build out this thing that you, that we talked about, right? Like this is literally your eight workflows in one that you sent that email, that very first email. And that's what, that's probably why I got so overexcited initially. But I think like, like let's not jump ahead of the gun here, but basically using third party tools, using third party APIs and workflows with this MCP kind of stuff. The goal is like to get to this file structure system, which just basically, as you just mentioned, that's just like, how do we ease you to create the Bible, right? Your strategy. And then like, how do we make it easy for you to like make it accessible to other workflows you create for like creating Twitter content, like actual content now. Yeah. Yeah. And then the other layer of that, the intelligence layer, right? Of the memory system. Right. And it started to like, you know, honestly, this, this actually like, we keep just talking like the last few weeks and days and then this and that about this stuff. It's like, as we like, like, I knew it was like a, this kind of like machine, this ecosystem of this machine, but then talking about the details, it's even maybe even bigger. Like there's all these like added things that like, we can like evolve it to. Right. Again, like things about, and I think there's some more like optimizations at the end. This is not like, like now. Things like for example, like competitor analysis listed. Right. What if for example, every week or maybe every, every month, let's say even just say every week, just for this, there's, there's a workflow, an automated workflow that, that, that, that produces in a document and you get notified of, let's say, like kind of like an RSS feed high level of like your competitors, what they've done, what they've launched, their new updates, all that stuff. And then puts kind of like an analysis, but it has to be clean. It has to be readable, digestible. Not like some long 20 page report. No one's going to read that. Something very insightful, concise, but actionable as well. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that could lead a few things that can lead the mark, maybe some marketing strategy that could maybe have you on top of the curve on a few things. Right. I had the curve and again, business insights in general.

William: Yeah. Right. Yeah.

Alexander: Um, as, as, as one example, there is, yeah, there's a few others, but yeah. Yeah. I'm kind of, I'm in a weird situation where like, I have a law that's mapped out in my head from a technical perspective and I'm just like coding it eight hours a day now and I'm not going quite quickly now. Um, and this was like, it doesn't, it doesn't look like it. Cause all you see the file system and like a little shitty website, but like, this is a fucking complicated thing to do in terms of mapping out the structure that enabled you to reflect in a file system. And we might not even do the file system approach cause you might be like, Hey, this is kind of shit or whatever. And if it doesn't solve the problem, I'm not working on it. It's not worth my time. Right. We're trying to solve a problem, but like there is some crazy shit that you can do by having this dynamic strategy that you're referencing. If you have a dynamic strategy. Okay. Like, let's just, just like, just assume that your strategy, your Bible. If we just call it the Bible.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Like, and we just basically look at marketing as like, this, this is like the super simple aspect of like visualizing marketing is like, you have the input, which is like the you, the human, and then maybe like some social listening stuff going on. So like the real, it's like the real world. And then this is like, just you as like the marketing kind of operators less like, you know, genius or whatever the fuck you want to call it. Right. That's like the two inputs that's going into the Bible. And the only output of the Bible is like the content. Right. That's like that. It was like a super high level. And it's like, you have to do this in engineering. You have to like dumb things down. It's like a very, I know this, I know I'm missing so much from this by the way, but like I'm trying to make.

William: No, no, I, no, it's too high. I know I get it. Okay.

Alexander: So yeah. Right. You, this is dynamic. So this is evolving, ever changing. Right. Right. Then here, like the content has like a platform that you post on and you have like performance associated to the content. Right. And like, let's assume that your metric is maximizing performance, but we can be whatever KPI you want. So basically like if this is, if you have a system that basically allows you to create like Bible version one and then Bible version two kind of going all the way down, what you're able to do like, and have them all like saved is you're able to basically do like mass AB testing of different versions of your strategy just to see which one works. So like if let's say Bible version one has tone of voice in a certain way and Bible version two is tone of voice in a certain way. And then you put out content like on different platforms or channels, which this, by the way, this is what like the, uh, uh, that's interesting. The Cluleys are doing. You're able to basically be like, Hey, was this like strategy change? Like, did it really impact me positively? Or like this social listening insight that we've got that has changed the state of our Bible. Is this state actually bringing us in the right direction? The Cluleys are taking us away because every update doesn't necessarily be, you know, all change is not good change. And that's very interesting. So, so basically you're AB testing different variations of the product itself. Uh, yeah, that's exactly it. Right. It's like you are, and this is, this is what this does. I have a state file, which represents the entire like state of your content strategy. Right. And then all I do is you just save like these in a list somewhere. And then when you post content, you just associate to the state that led to that content being created. And then that just gives you the experimentation engine. I was talking about the optimization loop that gives you the ability to like, okay, we're going to try five different versions of our marketing Bible. Like with different tones of voices or different target audiences, put all them out in the wild. And they'll be able to be like, oh, these are the states that work the best compare and contrast. And you could do like some crazy fucking analysis of like, okay, when

William: tone

Alexander: of voice is this, but content like target audience is this, we have this and all that kind of shit. But when you say put it out in the wild that that that's putting out a wall to the human, the loop that determines which one's the best. No, the human, the loop aspect here is like creating the strategy, right? The Bible. But then I want to do it in a way. I mean, I don't want to talk about too much now, because I just feel like it's gonna be overloading. But like, I basically, I believe, or my, my thesis is that if you architect these systems correctly, then the content should just be an output of the system. You shouldn't be involved in creating the content. So it should literally just be like a natural output of the system where I just press a button and it just spits out the content. Like you still define the workflows that gets into the content, but it's just an output of your system. So if you have. I agree. I know. Listen, I, I, I 100 % agree that that's I, and again, to get to that level, it's about fine tuning. Yeah. The Bible. Right? Exactly. It's well, it's like just changing the Bible. So like, I want to get to a point where like, what I basically done that what this engineering stuff I just did here is like, I've done this step, which is like the compilation step, which is like, you take the real world input, which is like your workflows and templates. We might extend it a little bit where you give it transcripts or whatever. This is like called compilation. Right. But then I'm going to like add, after this is done, I'm going to add an execution step, which is just like we define a few workflows to create tweets. And like, if it needs to use NAN as part of it and get like third party data and use examples or whatever, I don't give a fuck. We can still design that very simply, but this is just the execution step. And then all you do is just press the red button and then it just spits out all your tweets for like that day or whatever. Okay. So, so the benchmark, like, like how do you determine which one is better? Is that actually posting a platform and seeing what gets the most engagement? It depends on the KPI you have. Right. Like if your KPI is EVS score, for example. So, right.

William: So

Alexander: like, okay. So let's say like for your purpose, like, well, it depends. Like, okay. For example, let's say it is a copy purpose. Right. I'm not able to, whether it's a copy, it doesn't matter. It's any brand to do these rapid experiments on behalf of a brand. Yeah. There's no way that the infrastructure doesn't exist today. Well, not even that. Like, let's say if I had like the Bible one Bible two versions. Right. And I want to get, let's say different content for, for each one. Maybe they're good. Maybe that, but let's say what actually works in the real world. Right. Like I'd have to put out a lot of content iteratively fast, which is, is possible with the system.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: But, but putting that out, out there. Um, would, would, would, would it come off to a brand? Well, it hurt the brand because it comes off as too spammy and sometimes some content, because there's so many different iterations might conflict with each other in terms of let's say tone of voice, maybe direction, you know, et cetera.

William: Right. That's what I,

Alexander: I completely agree with you in terms of like, there's so many brands who are not going to want to do that. They're going to have a very strong idea of what the tone of voices. They don't really give a shit if it reflects with anyone. I'm sure that you're more familiar than I am with this. Um, and they're not going to want to risk kind of like their branding of having like some sort of like offset of their content somewhere, some AB test being like super rogue tone of voice. And like, they'll give a shit. We'd learn anything from it. They just like, no, we don't want that associated to our brand in any way whatsoever. But like, there was an incredible video that I watched and I sent it over to Chris, like I sent it over to you, which is like clearly, which is just dominating right now in terms of marketing disagree or agree with a marketing strategy and what they're putting out there. Yeah,

William: it works. It works.

Alexander: Right. And the reason

William: why

Alexander: it works is they've adopted basically this TV network strategy. Right. Where it's like, they basically create these like nodes of channels. So each channel is a node where they put out like 50 pieces of content a day across this node. And they're basically testing out like 40, they literally have 50 content creators. They call interns and they have like 45 different channels. And they're on each of those channels. They have like a kind of a niche or a theory. So it's basically a state, a Bible for each of those channels. Right. It has a different tone of voice. It has different kind of like content templates, all that kind of stuff. And they're basically putting out like 50 of these different ones and they're seeing which ones perform well. And the ones that perform well, they kind of like promote to like a main page that's directly associated to that brand. Like once they've seen that this channel is like validated, they're like, okay, you're now a main channel. Okay. You're part of Cluey now because you've a, you're performing content niche that works for us now. So it's like they go and test that. Then what qualifies is what's good goes to mainnet. Exactly.

William: That's exactly

Alexander: it. That's exactly. They have a, it's literally like dev developer operations where we have like test sandbox live. Right. They're doing that. They're just doing it manually because they, they have $15 million right now. They can pay all these fucking people and they have the overhead to be able to operate that. Like the system you described there while I got so excited to it is because it just connected so many dots of where this is going. And I just think that people should have the infrastructure to be able to do this pretty much. That's all. Okay. So, so then for Cluey, like they're like, I actually hope I'm the right thing here. They have this app that you, you paid 20 bucks for and it basically looks at your screen. You can record your, your, your meetings. And it's like, you can chat with like what you see on your screen.

William: That's

Alexander: what we're talking about. Yeah. I bought it last month. Um, just to try to test it out. And I actually wanted to use it. Not so much with a recording thing, more so because again, I was doing some co -marketing stuff. Uh, I was having some co -marketing stuff and there's a lot of context I was getting thrown into that. Like it's like, holy fuck. Like, I don't, I don't want to read all these chat messages and go back. Like it was, it was okay. The app was all right. Like it did its purpose. It was all right. Right. Like in terms of the use case. Sure. Um, it has some kind of UX issues that I wasn't crazy about, but it was also an MVP. I'm sure it could make it better, et cetera. Right. So that's the app we're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. And like famously it's a bad app. Like it doesn't solve a massive problem. It's just, they've completely cracked distribution, which is like why everyone's talking about it. They just, they, the strategy they're using is like cutting edge and it just fucking works. Like they're getting like millions of impressions. Yeah. So, so then like what, cause I, I don't really, I saw the marketing, it came up my page and people, I know people are talking about it and stuff. What, what is an example? So for example, this whole test net thing, right? They're in their kind of like testing phase. Are they using the Cluey brand or are they using some sort of like, like burner brand? They're using like, try Cluey, uh, get Cluey now, um, that kind of shit. So it's still associated to the brand. They just have, it's severe buy -in where they don't give a fuck. Like they don't give a fuck and they have this super edgy meme that's associated to Cluey. I mean, that's, that's a positioning thing that they've done, which I think is quite smart of them. Right. And I completely get about your reservations of like, Hey, someone's not going to be able to, you know, if you're an established brand, you don't want to be fucking around like major memes, but that's fine. You just define that in your strategy. Like that you're, you just have like small variations of your, your kind of Bible, which aren't like super far gone. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So then, so then they, they do that and then whatever performs well, they put it to their main page. So, so if I were to look at their main Twitter page, it is Twitter, their main social channel, like in terms of their TikTok and Instagram reels.

William: It's right.

Alexander: TikTok and Instagram reels.

William: Oh, okay.

Alexander: Interesting. Okay. Okay. So, so whatever, whatever is on there, those two channels, so to speak, have already been back -tested and performed well on their, their secondary channels. Oh

William: yeah.

Alexander: So what you, what you would see, which is super fascinating. If there's like a new template format they have on their channel, on their main channel, they, they basically define a channel about how closely associated is the brand. Right. So if they're trying like a super niche thing, they kind of make it kind of vague. So you're not entirely sure it's clearly associated. They're just testing out content templates. Right. If that content works, they kind of like just steal the template that worked and then just promote it to one of the main channels they have, or they turn it into like one of the main channels. Right. I mean, it's, it's exactly how TV studios work. Like a TV studio would put out like a pilot episode to see what works. They'll put out like 50, one or two would get good impressions and they promote it to a full kind of season. Right. And now it's a TV, it's an established TV show. That's like the kind of like strategy they're using. There's a video that explains it so much better than I could. Um, and they, they kind of define the new personas, like they call it like social architect and social scientists, which I kind of map as like, you know, like content engineer and then like content operator, that kind of thing, but whatever you want. Um, but I just think there's like a fundamental need for the infrastructure to enable to do so. And I think like the cracked agencies are the ones who kind of, and the ones who are going to win are the ones that are going to be kind of building out this infrastructure in house or using this infrastructure or understanding it at least. Yeah. I mean, this is kind of the new wave now with LLMs and the content generation on the fly, a new way of growth, of approaching growth marketing. A hundred percent. I know there's so many other aspects, but a hundred percent, this is a new way of doing it. Like, but the kind of key insight here is that if you're able to create content and take that content and loop it back to the state of the strategy that created it, you've basically closed the loop, which means that you're able to create this experimentation engine that you were talking about. And I was talking about where you can just create, you could just run fucking insane experiments, right? Like I'm lucky to have like a data science background that left to like that made me completely immediately see that opportunity. But I think in like row data pretty much, but basically if you just have like these experiments and you have like different like states associated to each of it, you can do like all sorts of comparative analysis, comparative analysis, sorry, of like when tone of strategy, like tone of voice is X and target audience is this. And you kind of merge them. You basically find your optimal strategy pretty much in a programmatic experimental way. And this shit would have been like crazy like four years ago because we just didn't have the means to do so. But today we definitely fucking.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. That's amazing. Yeah. Okay. That's. Yeah. I'm going to look more into this stuff because that is very interesting. Like the whole Chloe story and what you've been doing. I'll send you the video just for, just check it out if you want to in your own time. Okay. Okay. So. Imagine. Action items. I'll, I'll play around with that. Twitter. I don't need anything. I just need profiles. I'll, I'll try, I'll try by tomorrow to have, I actually have a lot done. I have to review it and there's some tweaks. Um, but today I'll do the brand fundamentals again, uh, based on, and I'll mess around with that. Competitor analysis. Are we good to, if, if, if by tomorrow I'm like, okay, we're good for brand fundamentals. We got to that point and, um, we can maybe start working comp analysis and see the limitations and the Twitter scraping thing. So I was, I was thinking about how to do this, right? Like I was, I'm working with, I have a friend of mine who his whole job is to sell, uh, NAN workflows. And he was like, what he used to do was like, he'd fucking create this huge documentation folder. He'd show you how to set up NAN. He'd show you how to set up air table, how to fucking integrate all the personal keys, all that kind of shit. I did that for a client. It was just, it just fucking was horrible because like, they'd be an issue. They'd have to come back and forth or whatever. So I suggest I just host it while I just run it. Right. And then we just kind of like, I make like tailored profiles for you guys. So execution, you run like through it. And I just invoice you at the end of the month of like that actual, like the actual cost. And I'll just show you like where the cost came from, but it will be my newt. Like if it's like less than 10, 20 bucks, I don't really give a shit. But if it's like 50 bucks for the workflows and whatever. Yeah, for sure. We, we, we give it, but, but yeah, no, that, that's funny. We can pay for that. The usage and stuff. But when you say workflows, are you talking about the actual scraping tool? Yeah. Yeah. Cause okay. Basically, if you look at my web scraper here, uh, firstly, there's a, I have an NAN, I have an air table instance. Right. Which I'd rather just share with you than like, have you set up your own air table? Cause you have to put all the permission keys, all that kind of shit. It's just a mess pain in the ass. And this one, this is like where it gets really fucked, but you kind of need to do it anyway, is like the actual workflow itself. Um, like I have like my Gemini key associated to it. I have, uh, the Twitter API key associated to it. Um, what else do I have? So sorry. Is that all Twitter? Is that your full Twitter? No,

William: this is just the,

Alexander: this is just the Twitter visual understanding workflow. This is the Twitter, uh, this is the Twitter workflow. And that triggers like a visual understanding workflow as well. So there's like three different workflows in one pretty much, but it all gives you the ability to, to do what I had there pretty much on it. How long, how, how long did it take you to do that? Uh, an hour and a half, probably. The full thing? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Because I mean, I would imagine maybe it would take longer, but obviously you, you, you know how to do this right off the bat. Like for me, it'd probably take definitely a couple of hours. Yeah. I mean, the software engineering background helps because you just like, you just kind of like map the stuff that you do to this. But I'm going to be honest. Like they also add like complicated shit in there where you're like, like for fuck's sake, I would be so much easier to just write this in code. Yeah. It's like the portability, the ability to share it with people, that kind of shit. Like I get it, whatever it's, it's, it's worth it. So I just, I learned it as a skill. If you want to call. So, so, so should I get, let's say a Gemini API and this and that, like, like, should I get any of that stuff for tomorrow or like, like just tell me what the best thing to do.

William: I

Alexander: would say like, let me just run it on my, on my thing and you just use it. And I'll just send you over the URL and you just use it. And I'll just show you guys the cost. Cause I can, I can see the exact cost on a, on a per, per down per basis. Pretty much. I mean, if you, if you want to, that's completely fine, but it just, it just, it is a lot of headache to have you set this up. Cause what I would do is I would just, I would just share the, the file with you, which I could share with you anyway, if you want to test it and play around with it, that's completely fine. And then you need to set up the air table stuff and then you need to set up the Gemini stuff. And then like, that's fine already. Like that's already a pain in the ass. But like, if it breaks, whatever reason I need to debug it, I need access to all your accounts and you run into it, all that kind of stuff. It just, it does add a lot of friction, but right now we're still quite early on. And like, I'm just trying to get these things working and make sure that we have like a working kind of workflow and then

William: over

Alexander: to you. Okay. So, so like, like in the future, after all this, like, cause I have any hosted on, I told you about that server. Yeah. Like later on, like, like, like, are, are we able to, to get this on my server as well? So I have a copy of it. Yeah.

William: Maybe not right

Alexander: now. Yeah. I think it's better off. Like just, let's just get this stuff working. You're using it. Cause we, we're not even sure this is the workflow we want. Right.

William: I

Alexander: didn't pay the ass with doing all that stuff. Like, let's just get to that. I'm saying like, let's charge like full speed ahead to the closest thing that enables you guys to actually use these kinds of tools and systems like in your day to day production. So you start to see like actual value, like time saved more value. And then let's start importing all of it into your own cloud infrastructure, your own fucking local infrastructure, whatever you want. Okay. Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah. That sounds good. Okay. Cool. All right. Cool. That's it. I'll, I'll keep, so are we able to do the same time tomorrow or

William: like one

Alexander: o 'clock, five o 'clock your time? Yeah, let's do it. And then did you, how do we kind of make progress towards the, like the Twitter stuff? Cause I'm getting just like some good signals. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, okay. So we talked about this on Monday. I'm okay. So I'm okay. August. So I have it in my, I have like a notion board of like goals. If you want to call it that, right? What if it is personal brand? Um, and I actually talked to Crystal yesterday about this, about like reigniting personal brand and getting into detail and telling you, telling her about, you know, us kind of coming up with the series and stuff. Um, I'm going to, so I'm offline on Friday. I'm going to Brazil. I'll be there for a bit. Uh, it doesn't change anything in terms of what we're working on or any, any of, any of that stuff. But why, why I'm saying that as I like this, I I'm using this change of scenery of going to end living in Brazil, as in some ways, um, maybe symbolically like a fresh start in some things. Right. Or not. Okay. First start, a fresh start is, is, is probably not the best. It's not really a fresh start. It's like, I'm running away from anything.

William: It's more like, Hey, I use that

Alexander: all the time. Change of environment is the best way to do it. Yeah.

William: Yeah. It's like, it's just,

Alexander: it, it, it's like a blank canvas in some ways in terms of like re it's not like I'm re inviting. Like it's just one of the things is it's, it's silly things. Like for example, I, I, I was in Paris, I've been in Paris for a couple of months, been really, really busy. And I like to be active, like either go to the gym or do something that happened. Right. And it's just been combination of busyness and, and just like, yeah, like, just, just have it basically going back to the gym in Brazil, you know, kind of like new, it's more like new scenery kind of jumpstarts, new habits. Right.

William: Going back to

Alexander: gym. One of them, why I mentioned is that there's a reason I'm saying this is that one of them is that kind of now be more vocal as a personal brand thing. Just now I'm going to kind of warming up my Twitter account and then working. And then like, how do I think, I don't want to start with like, with like, you know, us talking about this, my Twitter account, because it seems very abrupt, not to say anyone actually gets a fuck because no one doesn't know it's looking at like, so like, and maybe it's a, it's a mental thing too, because literally no one fucking cares. Yeah. Um, but my point is that like, maybe I'll just set the stage, get warmed up and then start to kind of like start this whole thing about building on public, starting with the brand fundamentals. I like, I'll obviously consult you and like, how do you want to be introduced to this?

William: Um,

Alexander: in terms of like, how are we doing this? So there's a few things kind of warm it up, kind of say, okay, you know, like, just like talk about, I got to talk to some Web3 bullshit. And then I want to talk about some marketing ideas. I have just in general, outside of AI stuff, AI stuff, um, this whole building and public thing, but not in like, yeah, I want to find a good angle, which is basically the angle that we're talking about. So like, how do we create a system here that there is a new wave of marketing, the marketing architect and that's in that thing. Right. Or, or, or this whole marketing infrastructure. Right. Um, what does that look like? What is this new way in the AI revolution? What does marketing look like in that sense? Right. What am I building towards that? How am I pushing this forward? Having you in part of this as like the engineer working on this. Right. And, and, and even any, any sort of ways that you are, or personality angles, you want to also for me to demonstrate in my thing, like in terms of how I describe what you're working on your purpose, your mission. So I can also amplify that and to reiterate that. Right.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: That's kind of like a secondary channel for you for that. Um, formats, Twitter, which to, to, to answer your question, when do you want to kickstart this off? Friday, I'm, I'm in Brazil. I'm going to be like offline moving and stuff. Um, this, this weekend I'm going to start tweeting probably let's say a week from today.

William: Yeah. That's fine.

Alexander: We can, we can, we can start to like introduce and kind of like talk about this. I'm going to, I'm, I have a sub stack. I only have one article there. It was kind of a thing I'm going to start adding maybe as a series or something around that. I, I, I like to have some sort of structured content thing, but I also know sometimes that could be limiting or it could be paralyzing to always think of it that way. Yeah. And, and kind of have just fucking, just fucking create content. There's like, you know, anyways, um, how do you have any, any, let's say anything you want to like, I'd say see in terms of the collaboration. Sure. Um, that, that, that, that, that I can help with or I can be part of. Yeah. I mean, so I mean, three points. First point. Uh, there was a very famous case of the, when the U S soldiers went to Vietnam, they all did like a heroin and they're all like, Oh my fucking God, they're going to come back and I'll be addicted to heroin. And like, it went from like 80 % to like 1 % and cause environment change led to that. So fully on board. So fully on board with like the idea of changing your environment leads to changing your habits is like scientifically back. So that's completely fine. Just thought there's

William: a

Alexander: point I was going to say before it completely unrelated now. Uh,

William: sorry,

Alexander: sorry. So they, they, they, they, the, the, the, the soldiers went to Vietnam. Um, and what, what, what, I don't get the heroin part. They all got addicted to heroin. Like 85%.

William: They all got addicted.

Alexander: 85 % of them got addicted to heroin and opium. Um, and then the Americans were like, Holy fuck. We have like 500 ,000 soldiers going to come back to the U S all being addicted to heroin. They all came back. And like, none of them were addicted to heroin because they realized it was a consequence of the environment they were in and nothing to do with their addiction to heroin. So the minute that they went back to Iowa, where the fuck they came from, they didn't have the kind of like triggers in their head that triggered their heroin addiction. It

William: was just super interesting

Alexander: thing. How changing your environment drastically leads to changes in your habits. I completely got that. Um, anyway, uh, the second point, uh, I've been in this space like the last, like, like very diligently for the last like year. Right. In terms of like following Twitter, I haven't been posting on Twitter. I've just seen that for the last like week or two. And I've got like, I tripled my followers, but it was like from like 12 to like 50. There's nothing much, but whatever. Um, and like, I, I really think there's like a, a super deep need for the type of content that has more theoretical basis because of the ones that resonate really well today from the stuff that I'm targeting, which is like the kind of like marketer stuff. I'm like guys who create like free NAN workflows and they, they put up posts like a fucking like common, uh, you know, viral. If you're trying to get this viral workflow hack that allows you to create like the best take talks, all that kind of shit. I just fucking hate it.

William: Just like, just like, just like

Alexander: clickbait bullshit, clickbait bullshit, but they get like hundreds of thousands of engagements, right? Like millions.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Right. And I think like everyone's trying to navigate this landscape and all these marketers have like this like fucking fear of missing out, which they a hundred percent should be having. Right. And I, I know that cause I was an engineer who was doing the same thing. So they're all like looking at these NAN workflows and they see like 50 different nodes and they're like, Oh, this is going to power my entire agency and all that kind of shit. Right. But like, there's no like theoretical understanding, like talking about like the studio model I was talking about, or like the kind of engine loop and like the Bible, all that, all that other shit. Right. So people just kind of like shooting in the dark, spending money in all these fucking random platforms. Right. Which is like just all the markers I've spoken to the agency I'm working with have said the exact same thing. So I'm very confident there's a need there where I wasn't so sure. Right. Was I a hundred percent see how this benefits me as someone who's building in this space. I, I wasn't sure how you were going to spin it out to like entirely benefit you as the kind of person who's bringing the information over from the operator perspective, like being someone who's developing and sharing that theory. So I was always curious, like, is that a thing he'd be interested in and like, how would it benefit his brand? And if there's like more ambitious ideas that he can kind of lean into as well. I personally think that if you're the first guy in anything, especially as something as big as this, like your agency, whatever business you have through association will benefit. Right. But I mean, that's up to you to kind of figure out. Um, I know for, I know exactly how it benefited me and I know exactly like how I kind of put out my structure, like my, my content, I'm, I'm like 25. I am super outgoing. I, I'm going to take extremely radical. Like I want to be like the 99 .9 percentile of building out in the open. Like I'm, I was considering just like buy, I have like a podcast thing here. I was considering buying like a live, like Twitch stream to show me coding and all this kind of stuff. I'm thinking of ideas. I'm meeting up with filmmakers in London to kind of like attach themselves to me and try and do all this kind of shit. So I'm just trying to think of a way to kind of like mail this together, but I'm also very conscious of, and I need, uh, have a deep understanding of, of your side of it, of like what is, as someone who's going to be building extremely in the open, like there's some stuff that we want to talk about that should have no nothing, like should not even be remotely public. Right. So I need to know the boundaries as well, that kind of stuff. So that's, that's where my kind of head is at pretty much because like, that's the kind of like business guy that I want to be in terms of like my personality. I think that's going to be my leverage. Yeah. Okay. So, so basically what I'm hearing, just like you're saying that, um, okay. So right now, are you, are you doing that? Like, like, like you're doing that in terms of your posting, but you're saying you haven't technically started that yet. Well, I'm, I'm just posting now to experiment and just fuck around with

William: it. So like, you're like warming

Alexander: up. I'm warming up. Yeah. I've been doing that for the last two weeks. I would say I've got some good like signals. Um, I think I mentioned this the other week. Like I had like someone followed me and like went through all my socials and everything. Like clearly was really a big fan of my work and like the sub stacks and stuff. And I was like, why were you so interested? And he was like, yeah, cause he posted a gym selfie that showed that you're a real person. And I was like, okay, so human engagement, like clearly, uh, an aspect here. Um, and that's like really good for my strategy. So, so, so, so the reason I'm asking this question is that like, this is still like in terms of a hundred percent, what percentage are you from like your ideal state of this building public, this personal brand. And I, I, I'm not talking about follower accounts. I'm talking purely in terms of, um, how much content, how much of you, you put out to the world. What percentage is that? Uh, I'm, I think I'm like literally nowhere near, uh, how much content I'm putting out, which is kind of why I'm building the system as well.

William: So

Alexander: yeah, no, no, for sure. So like, like if a hundred percent is like full fledged, like full throttle, you're like your ideal state of what you think your ideal state at this current moment is what percentage are you at? Uh, like 5 % probably right now. 5%. Okay. So you're 5 % loading into that with a hundred percent.

William: I think

Alexander: I would want like an almost like TV series going on, like, which is like building this out in the open, talking like the theory of all this kind of shit. Right. Like, you might as well be ambitious with this. Um, so I'm trying to find a filmmaker who's going to help me kind of build this out. And, and I think initially it should just start as like a podcast format a little bit, pretty much just the simplest. I have everything I need. I I've already done it before. I had a podcast before as well. It, I know how it kind of works. Um, and then kind of build out like this TV series format pretty much a little bit. I want to be tweeting a shit ton. I fuck LinkedIn. And then like self -sack.

William: I hate LinkedIn. Yeah. Yeah.

Alexander: So, uh, sub stack, like once a week, pretty much. I like sub stack. I just, I don't do sub stack for followers. I do sub stack because I write, I sit and I write about these theories. Like I would like just dump everything from my head and like, kind of like extrapolate, like, what is the theory of whatever the fuck it is. And I kind of developed my theory is like, it's more for thinking than anything else.

William: It's more like,

Alexander: yeah. Like and journaling and kind of organizing our thoughts and just like, you know, putting it, I get that. Yeah. Okay. So I see. Okay. So, so basically the most ambitious thing I've heard so far is that you want to make a series out of this, like your own kind of personal, you know, series. Um, is this like, like, for example, like, whatever, like how, what is that? And the reason I'm asking this is for a few reasons, just to see where, cause I'm definitely not doing any series. Like I, I

William: don't

Alexander: plan it.

William: That's

Alexander: like, you know, I know. I mean like that, you know, like Hermosey. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do. Um, he doubled down in content. He does like, I think it's like 300 pieces of content a week, something like that. Right. Kind of similar to what Cluley does. Uh, he's, he may, he, I think he's done it before and this and that, right. Other people do the same thing. Um, Gary Vee, you know, Gary Vee, right. All those guys, right. They, they, they legit hire a production studio, a production team and follow them around. Right. And then all that stuff. Like, I know that's on, that's like probably, that's the extreme. That's like on the higher level, but you kind of want to do something kind of like that in some shape or form. Yeah. But more authentic and like less, I think they, they kind of just go for followers for the sake of followers. Like they would just put out viral fucking like gym videos, all that kind of shit. I'm okay with that to an extent, but like, I'm, I'm really just like super interested in the distribution stuff. So it'd be super niche to be honest with you. Um, it's just like kind of explaining it and breaking down concepts in an interesting format. And then there's other like angles I'm interested in as well. Like, but yeah, basically somewhere along that line, like, I think that's still a few months away. Um, but like building up to that, I think would be, would be the objective from a marketing perspective. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I would say like in kind of like this, this, this kind of scope of what you are looking towards for a personal brand for me, it's, um, it's posting at least once, maybe twice a day. We'll see. Um, and, and, and, and the content that say, if I see these in content pillars or so, um, obviously this stuff that we're talking about, um, web three, I'm still trying to find. Like there is a connection between what we're doing in web three. Right. Um, in terms of this could be applied to web marketing in some ways. Right. And

William: there's,

Alexander: there's very nuanced things that I could even develop this system as you're developing the cold marketing stuff that I was talking about, or maybe scraping telegram or scraping X, Y, and Z for context. I

William: see

Alexander: very, very specific pain points in web marketing that maybe work flows and we can talk about X, Y, and Z and all this stuff. So that that's all one thing. Um, podcast, I wouldn't do a podcast. I'd be, let's say on your podcast, if you were to do one. Right. Um, I think a series of building in public. And doing, let's say for each phase. I don't know. It could be each phase. It could be one big podcast, one big podcast video explaining the full workflow.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Right. Or maybe, or maybe it's separate videos. I like the fact that when we talk about this stuff, we talk about, let's say, let's say the strategy, the architecture, we talk about the actual execution, the nitty gritty, but we also also have the soul of like the philosophy of it.

William: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Going

Alexander: back to first principles, going back to like, okay, what, what, where do we see it now? What's it, let's say now, what's it as a cutting edge, but what's it in the future? Right. And again, this whole, when you're telling me with the whole Cluey thing, I was thinking is that like, you know, marketers are not going anywhere and content like, but things that Cluey, yeah, I do see that this is going to be, let's say more, it's a very cutting edge approach right now, which could maybe in a couple of years, maybe sooner could be the de facto way of how you approach content. Right. And if that's the case, that actually will be, there might be even more of a demand of marketers. Yeah.

William: Right.

Alexander: They do this, you

William: know?

Alexander: Absolutely. I kind

William: of think marketing

Alexander: is like the only skill that's going to kind of be necessary, like, or one of the only major skills would be necessary. Like it's getting easier to code every day. It's getting harder to get people's attention every day. Right. Exactly. And that's, and that's a good line right there. Right. It's about like, you know, it's like when women code and that's even writing or whatever it is becomes a commodity, right? What's the most valuable thing? It's attention. Right.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: Right. So anyways, the point I'm trying to make is that like, to answer your question very, very like, like briefly, there's no real boundaries. I would, I would just like, like, just like, I guess, first thing is like, you know, if you put out anything, maybe it's beginning next week or so, we can talk about what we got pushed through, you know, like whatever I push out from you, I'll let you, I'll let you see it. You let me see what you push out and stuff. Like, I'm not going to be like a stickler in terms of like, oh, no, no, no, not this, not like that, but just like, you know, just kind of see, like, give a heads up, review that stuff.

William: Sure.

Alexander: And yeah, like, I know, I know, like, I'm happy to help in any way to, to help with your personal brand stuff. For me, it's a priority, but it's not like, like we, we have different, I guess, goals with it. Right. And ambitions. Right. So you're, you're, you're definitely on a higher level. I want to do, cause I think it's also necessary just to survive in, in, in, in a new world. Right. I think people are going to be like, you know, what, whether it's on your, what's, what's your portfolio website, what's your resume, what you're about. They can be like, what's your social handle,

William: you know,

Alexander: what's your Twitter handle. Right. Or YouTube, whatever.

William: And then we

Alexander: start to, sorry. What's your personality? Who the fuck are you? Like I want to do business

William: with

Alexander: you. Yeah. I mean, that's just like a, like a, a theory as well, which is just like what everything gets commoditized. All these services get commoditized. People are going to buy from people at the end of the day. Like, I feel like, again, you build around things that never change and people are going to buy from people. I don't think they're going to want to buy from like these AI stuff. And like, they, they're going to want to have brands associated to it, which is why you have like fucking KSI and Logan Paul working like a billion dollars in sales from some shitty energy drink because it's just associated to their brand name. Right. So it's a, it's an interesting kind of thing. Just to expand here. You said one idea, we could create a high quality snippet series. We break down each phase of the journey, like chapter recap, it'd be great to combine actual playoff play steps and honest takes. Okay. Okay. So would that be a film separately or was that, would that be part of like weekly calls anyway? And I kind of just find a way to stick these together and add context and visualizations. Uh, I think, I mean, how I had it in my mind is that if we flush it out by, cause right now there's not a discovery. There's a lot of like back and forth questions and stuff. Once we get to each phase, like brand fundamentals, once we get it to a point where it's like, Oh, this is really good, which it's, it's almost there, right. I think in terms of just like tweaks and stuff, then we do a recap. Right. And maybe we like, you know, talk about like what we, what our goal is, what was our objective, how we approach it, what are the challenges, all that stuff. Right. And then seeing like why this is necessary. Cause the thing is, is this, especially with brand fundamentals, you, you think it's, it's a common sense for people to do this right before they go there. It's not, people don't do that. It's crazy. It's crazy. Um, and, and, and maybe some do, I'm not saying not everyone does it, but I think there is like, especially there's a lot. I think there's a lot of bad marketers in this space. And I don't mean that as a put down. I think it's because it's, it's easier to be a marketer. The barrier of entry to be a marketer is easier than being, let's say a programmer engineer. Sure. Right. So you see that you have a lot of people that go into this video on marketer and maybe they'll learn a few things and this and that, and then they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll be really good at trying to like explain what they do. But when it comes down to execution, you're understanding what the action you're doing and doing it well, they really fall short. Right. And I work marketers, my flat, my house is for three of the marketers in the house. Right. And I

William: see

Alexander: that firsthand where I'm just like, Oh, okay. That's usually, Oh, I don't really give a shit what the post says. Yeah. I just got to get it out today. I'm like, all right. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and I, and that's the thing. It's like, it's like, there's, I think there's, there's like, I think one part of the communication too, is that even aside from like this high level stuff that we're doing brand fundamentals, just to explain to people why you need it, purely forget about the AI stuff just for marketing. Yeah. You know, as, as a cornerstone. So it just almost by doing this, people will also understand not only the high level stuff, but they actually get a fundamental first principle view of how to build out a marketing system and stuff. Right. And now you're doing it in the lens of it's like doing it with AI. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one, one thing I was going to do because since I have transcripts of all our video calls, right. I'm recording with, with, with Lou. So I, I haven't done anything with them from a video perspective. I'm not putting anything out from a video perspective, but I wanted the transcripts and those for this exact reason, I'm going to probably create a workflow, probably using this tool of them creating, um, where I put all the transcripts in a single like data folder and I kind of analyze all of it. And I, I ask it to like, and I get like a target audience profile. So I'll use my own like strategy document to find like, what would my audience find interesting to kind of be in this series? Right. Or this, whatever the fuck. Right. And it's going to extract all of it. It's like break it down to questions or whatever. And I would basically use that to create some visualizations, infographics. And then we can kind of have that as a template to go down with that feedback session or whatever the fuck you want to do. Like a loop. So we were like, okay, this is what the AI kind of asked us a question to reflect upon. And we just reflect open and allowed out loud and kind of like make it. Do you know what I mean? Like we're repurposing the content a little bit.

William: Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

Alexander: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a good idea. Um, yeah. Yeah. So yeah, like, like, like formats could be a, like, sub stack. Like, I, like, I was thinking of maybe making kind of like what you're kind of doing in the sense of like putting all your, like, like, like putting all your ideas in an organized way as like a journaling method of kind of like telling the story of like how you're doing, how you're approaching it and this and that. I was going to do it for this kind of thing as well. Right. Maybe. And maybe it's something that could be like, it's like this kind of, it's like a structured chapter thing, chapter on brand fundamentals. This is, uh, this is like, I don't know what the actual structure would look like in terms of the inside each chapter, how I would approach it. Um, I want to make it human though. I like, I don't want to make it so it feel reads like a textbook.

William: Right. Right.

Alexander: So, so like,

William: it

Alexander: has an element to it. Um, we can embed the videos, uh, articles. We can do, let's say, aside from like the podcast or let's say like, like summaries of each thing video wise, honestly, like I'm sure after this, we will like, there's, there's going to be more stuff that's going to come up. That's okay.

William: Let's do a

Alexander: video on this, right? Like it's thick things we don't know right now, but it's like, Hey, this would be great to talk about. We can also like, actually, you know, it would be kind of cool. Um, I, again, maybe I'm thinking a little too, too, too far in the future, um, to do stunts. When I say stunts is like stunts doesn't like challenge some sort of, it's a conventional way of thinking or, or, or, or, or think or something that conversation is happening with a certain thing. And do, let's say there's kind of like social experiment, social stunts back with data, back with like these new ways, maybe taking one sort of modification of our model and saying, Hey, can we do X, Y, and Z? Right. Yeah. And, and, and that's a stunt. Right. And it approves it for a thing. It's going to get attention. But also I like challenging to the point of like, Hey, like, do I think I'm as good as I think I am? Let me prove it. Right. And let me put it out to the open. Right. And if you pull it off, it's like the payoff is amazing.

William: It's like,

Alexander: cause, cause a lot of people don't, won't have the balls or have that, that sense of like sharpness to actually approach it. Right. I

William: think

Alexander: the opportunity here is huge because I can fucking code anything like very quickly. Right. So if, if you like, if we have like the stunt thing we're talking about, right? Like there's nothing that stops me for like within two hours, making a landing page that has all of our live experiments running that we just kind of like reference in a video. And like, okay, I just check out this landing page to check out the experiment. We kind of update you a week or whatever the fuck. And we kind of reference it or whatever. Like when I, when I sent you that proposal, uh, that huge proposal for whatever fucking reason, it was all on a website. Like that was like super quickly bi -coded. It was a decent website. Just like interesting ways to approach it. So I'm like really down to experiment with really like guerrilla marketing tactics. I've also spent two months this year in the south of France fucking doing like guerrilla TikTok marketing where I had my phone like ran into stores and shit and doing all this like public stunt stuff. So I'm very comfortable doing rogue shit as well. So I'm down to be very experimental with it. But I was like, my primary question for you is like, how would you see this kind of like, like just say in fairyland where like you're, you know, both of us, like this is performing well. How would you see that like benefiting the non -citizen brand or, or like bringing you directly like money and clientele? Purely, I honestly, I really think that, um, by talking about, let's say these, I get the new way of, let's say approaching marketing, not so much as like this operator doing these certain tasks in the marketing, but building on a system that does it for you. And you're the operator of the actual architecture itself. Yeah. Um, I think that's something that is, so you said, you said, you know, this is my bet in the future. I generally think it's a good bet. I think it's inevitable. Right. So if your first movers and the ones who are developing this and really like what we're doing is like the board marketer is maybe like that one person that's kind of maybe first mover in this sort of thing. Yeah. But he's, he's now, there's a, there's like this new, new category of this, right? If we now come into this category and actually set the stage and like push this forward, we are now part of the first mover movement, so to speak. Right.

William: So

Alexander: if that's the case, a lot of brands, a lot of, a lot of projects will want to, will want this as it's a, um, like either part of their marketing department, part of their stack, or maybe a way for like, for us to like service them. Right. And like, Hey, that we can develop this. Cause that's what we're doing for our coffee here. Yeah. All other clients we have, we start with the coffee, we, we do other things and it, and it becomes more about like how we approach, approach, approach marketing as a whole. You know,

William: Would you call it differently?

Alexander: Because I'm, I'm reading, I've, I'm in the process of reading the 20, the 22 immutable laws of, of marketing. And there's obviously like, if you're not first, then create your own thing. Would you call

William: it

Alexander: something? So you completely operate the mind space of that new niche. I, sorry, say the last part again, the mind space thing. Would you mind

William: share

Alexander: the mind share? Would you call it like a new category? Cause vibe marketing is a new category, but this is like a category than by marketing. Would you call it something new to operate that entire? Yeah, no, no, for sure. Like I, I don't consider this by marketing. I think by marketing is part of that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like I, I would say this is a new category. Yeah.

William: For sure. Cause

Alexander: I was reading it and I was like, fuck, I need to think of what the category is because we basically, we creating a new category and then we'd be coming at it. Like where we operate the mind share is I operate the architect side and you operate the operator side or you're the architect and I'm the engineer side. However, we split it up. Right. But we're kind of like creating a new category and like the, the niche is within those categories. Like if you want to go to you to actually fucking build, bring traffic to your brand in terms of clientele, that's one thing. If I, if you want me to help them architect solutions, like I operate that mind show. Does that kind of make sense? That kind of like split.

William: Yeah.

Alexander: It's, it's like, I don't know if this is the best example, but like, you know, you've got, it's like another philosophy if you want to tell it, but then a philosophy with an actual approach. Right. Kind of like a martial art in some ways.

William: Right. Cause I'm,

Alexander: I, every martial art has its own kind of philosophy, but it has the actual part of the actual, you know, martial art itself. Right. And it's like the approach here is that like, if, if I were, this is what I would like, okay, you know what, maybe this is the best way to define it. It's August now. Right. Or, you know, we got like a day, Friday is August. By next year, it will be earlier, but let's say by 2026, August, I should not, and I don't plan to. Approach marketing. And when I say approach, approach to brand fundamentals, that will stay constant and maybe some kind of new things. But the way that, as you put it, operate marketing should not be how I've been operating the last year and this year, which is how I've been doing. It was, you know, through, let's say chat LLM, choose my, my, my, my favorite LLM for whatever purpose. Save documents, put them in context, blah, blah, blah. That really, since 20, early 2024, chat GPT came up, what? 20, no, it was 20, 2023. Like 2020, December, 2022 was chat GPT or something, something like that. Let's call it 2023. 2023 changed because it, it expedited the way that you consume and maybe, you know, create content. LLM's got better. You got more competition. And then it, it still kind of did this whole thing conversation based marketing. Right. And it was, it changed my approach, but I found myself being like, okay, I'm technically probably 10 times the output pre chat GPT, but I'm, I'm actually probably even busier. Yeah.

William: And I don't

Alexander: know. I don't know if that's a case of maybe either getting more work or more clients or the demand, because also too, it's like, oh fuck, I can get it to this level. Can I get it even better? Can I get it better? Right. Sure. So it's more like, like I can spend 15 minutes working on something, or I can spend an hour and 15 minutes making it so much better. Yeah. With the thing, right?

William: Pull the actual

Alexander: lever.

William: And

Alexander: yeah, exactly. Pull the lever like, like harder and you'll get a better output. But now I'm at a point where it's like, fuck yeah. Like it's like, I can't, you cannot run an agency without like, there's, there's this book called, I gotta send it to you. You'll like it. I forget the, I forget the book's name. I'll send it to you. Anyways, there's a good quote. It's like, and this is very much, I'm guilty of this. A lot of small business owners are, and me and Crystal are very, very guilty of this. And I've been trying to avoid, this is not avoid, but like get out of this rut. And it's like, you know, you're either working in the business or you're working on the business. I'm definitely working in the business. Right. And the difference is this working into the business. It's like, it's like this. It's like, you know, a lot of business owners go, maybe this was an analogy. A lot of business owners, small business owners are very good. Let's say operators at something. Let's say you got, you got, you got Sally, who's amazing at making cupcakes. She's so good at making cupcakes. Her friends and family tell her, you know what, you should make your own cupcake. Like, you should make your own bakery. Right. And Sally, Sally quits her job at the bakery to make her own bakery. And she makes a lot of cupcakes and she makes the best cupcakes. But she's like overwhelmed with everything because really her passion was making cupcakes and she makes it really well. The problem is, is that she was working in the business. She was an operator. She was never a business owner. She was never working on the business. Right. And, and with chat GPT, and I'm kind of alluding to this is that all the clients we work with, we're working in the business. We service our clients. We do have contractors working very specific things, whether it's designer or helping with, with the kind of some other, just like writing and copywriting, whatever, right. Posting, et cetera. But very much Crystal and I are in all the client calls, whether we divvy it up or whatever. The point I'm trying to make is that this system that I'm making is like, for me, aside from, yeah, we can hire more people and stuff, but still, then you've got like, you, like, you can still be working the business because again, it's hard to find good marketers. And when you find good marketers, they're also very expensive.

William: Right.

Alexander: Yeah. Yeah.

William: I get the analogy I'm

Alexander: trying to say, by the way, which is the, like the McDonald's analogy, which is like, if the McDonald's brothers spent all the time cooking, like burgers, they would never have taken the step back to actually look how the whole system works and like innovate in it and then create fucking McDonald's, which is what you kind

William: of,

Alexander: which is like, you shouldn't be on calls or like writing content. You should be thinking about how everything, like, where's like the leverage points and how do you kind of like manipulate and structure them to, to operate the thing more effectively. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So, so, so I, I see this as the way out from working in the business to working on the business. Right. And, and, and that's, that's, that's a lot of like, this is kind of like, what I see is like the, that, that, the golden pathway. Right. And I'm not saying it's going to be perfect. I'm not going to say that like, you know, I work on like, we get this done. I could kick back and just, you know, work two hours a day, you know, like, you know, it's not going to be like that. But I wouldn't like, for example, today, I spent like all morning working on one thing for a client. It was also kind of a thing. It was like a, like a, like a creative thing. So I didn't mind, mind doing it, but I, I fucking time, time goes by. Then I had that call. Then that's why I was late. Cause I, it

William: was like

Alexander: four, four hours in the morning, just, I didn't woke up early to do that. Right.

William: But,

Alexander: but, but time is like, you know, the most precious thing that you have. And it, and when you're busy, as you probably know, it fucking goes. Like you're busy a day is like a second. Yeah. You have to like, be very intentional about what you're fucking doing every day.

William: Very intentional. Very, very

Alexander: intentional.

William: Take that one

Alexander: hour to like make a workflow that saves you like 20 minutes in a week. That shit builds up, man. Like then like three months time, you'd have like four hours saved a week or five hours saved a week. And you could make that one hour, two hours and like exponentially grows. But, um, yeah, I mean sick. Okay. Well, like maybe, uh, let's, okay. So we have a call tomorrow. Um, I hope to make some progress on my stuff as well. And then like, let's maybe like set up a call or dictate, like dedicate like half of the call next week to you and I like kind of like working on our own strategy stuff for, for our Twitter personalities. And then, um, I think I have a call with Crystal where she gave me feedback on my Twitter anyway. She said she has a lot of feedback, which I assume is a good thing, but also bad.

William: Yeah, she's good. She'll, she'll, no,

Alexander: no, she'll, she's all, all her feedback. I just, I know, I know you don't take it personally, but not to say she doesn't want your feedback. I've known you. She told me that she, she's going to give you feedback on, uh, she said you asked her and she's going to give you feedback. All

William: her, all her feedback is

Alexander: well intentioned for you to, to be as good.

William: 100%. I need, that's why I need it.

Alexander: I don't want bullshit. I'm like, Hey, it's doing well. It's like, no, this is fucking shit. This is shit. Like I learned from that. Yeah. She, she, she, I don't think she'd be as, as, as, as direct. Um, but, uh, I don't know, maybe she will, I don't know, but, but I don't know what her feedback is, but I'm sure she's good. She's, she, she, she has a very good eye for this episode. Sounds good. All right. You asked the right person. I did. I did. All

William: right.

Alexander: Well, cool, man. Um, so for tomorrow, just a wide touch points, the MCP tool will be ready for you. So I'm sure to have you, I'll just send it over to Jason and you import it into your cursor. And then as we mentioned, like, try the folder stuff, put like a brand fundamentals in the folder. We'll say limit the context to this output here. Um, see how far you get with it. Optimize the prompts as we mentioned. Um, and then ideally I come in with my folder structure and then like, we just plug it in and we kind of work from there. So the whole thing kind of works seamlessly as we can start focusing more on workflows, which was the focus. Awesome. Cool. Awesome. Cool. All right. Well, good talk. Good, good meeting. And, uh, yeah, we'll, we'll talk tomorrow. Sounds good, man. All right. Catch you later. Take

William: care, Alex.

Alexander: See ya.

William: I spent the last year trying to put my own game console. Oh. Wow. It's up and it's Friday. My team and me, a hundred other friends beside me. We're celebrating what they've done and how the town's been. I see some forever you're about.
