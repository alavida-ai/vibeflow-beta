william: it was like almost a full day, but it was like around like four to six hours at least, right, I had some breaks and stuff, but, so I'll tell you what I was doing, so we left off, I think our last meeting was like, okay, today we do brand fundamentals, we start to kind of like go and kind of go through this, like, okay, you know what, let me, let me try to take a stab up this stuff and get a head start, so that on the meeting, if I have any questions, we can go over stuff, you know, we can kind of speed through it, So the first thing I did was create that agent persona, you know what we talked about, like those agent instructions, sure, I put them in the, okay, so let me, let me, let me share my screen here, I'm not sure if they, I think it did apply, I'm not sure, to be honest, right, but I'll show it to you, so, So, um, oh, a few things, uh, before we start, um, uh, I saw your invoice, uh, well, we were going to pay it this, this week, I think Crystal had mentioned to give you, to give us a wallet?

alexander: Yeah, I mean, I, I did the Stripe thing with the wallet, but I can actually just change it, if it's, I, I thought that she just didn't like see it, but I think she just wants an actual wallet, right, so I'll give her, Yeah, yeah,

william: the best thing to do is just give us a wallet address.

alexander: Cool, all right, no worries, I'll just give my finance or something like that.

william: Okay, cool. Cheers. Um, so, okay, so, uh, the other thing too is, after the call, we can talk about how we can, or right before we jump off, um, talk about the personal brand stuff. Cool. Right, I know I've been holding up, it's been kind of on my mind. Uh, there's a few ways that, like, I, I was, I, like, just very high level, I wanted to do this, I got more time, I, I need, I was kind of doing it last year, and then I kind of stopped, I got really busy. Not an excuse, really, um, needs to be a more of a priority, especially in this day and age, right? Those are the personal brands, they're just going to get the more exposure, more opportunities, et cetera. Sure. Um, and, and, yeah, so, this kind of comes in a timely way, but I've also been very protective in terms of what that really is, in terms of showcasing that stuff. I'll, I'll tell you my reservations and how we can maybe maneuver around it, um, and kind of come up with a plan, kind of like, you know, because I know you're working in your own personal brand. I got to kind of jumpstart mine and how we can kind of have this kind of co -partnership in that sense as well, as one of kind of, like, these storylines, the personal brand, so to speak.

alexander: Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense.

william: Okay, cool. So, um, going back to here, Agent Persona, um, I went down a rabbit hole. This was like, this prompt, um, was probably like an hour in the making. It actually did, uh, uh, I serve a lot and there's kind of back and forth testing and this and that. What I did, my, my method, and actually now I'm starting to do this more. And I've, this is at, put my ideas on, let's say, ChatGPT or Cloud, whatever, right? Run through it and then have it restructure what my thoughts are after I kind of like chat to it in more of, let's say, um, a cleaner markdown format.

alexander: Right. Gotcha.

william: Right. So this, this, this was the result of this, um, this actually, um, I, I liked, I liked the outputs it was giving. Right. It was like, it really elevated the outputs in the sense of like, don't shooter code things. Don't, you know, like not, not like it pushed back on things that was not necessarily either impactful or maybe just not in the right direction. Whereas if I didn't have this prompt, ChatGPT or Cloud would have just kind of went with it. Right. Sure. So it was, it was good in that sense. Um, before we move on, do you, I know this is probably a lot right now, but is this too long? Is this like, like anything here that, that you're kind of skimming and it's kind of like you're flagging as maybe this is not the approach or any feedback at all?

alexander: Yeah. So this is actually great timing. Like it just seems like a lot of shit is coming together right now, um, at the right time, which is good. I mean, maybe just come chronically again, online and following all this stuff very closely, but, uh, Claude, who are the guys behind Anthropic, other way around, sorry, Anthropic guys behind Claude, um, have basically released this new update called Claude Agents. And what we're kind of seeing in the last few weeks, and this doesn't change anything in terms of our strategy to approach this is that like Claude code has taken it. Can you hear that in the background, by the way? Is that really annoying?

william: No. Uh,

alexander: cool. Claude code is kind of taking over cursor a little bit in terms of like the best agent to use. And a large part of that is because of their pricing is just significantly better. It's, it's per usage, um, which honestly like kind of comes out to more expensive in the long run, but people like, like it more because it's just more kind of transparent. And they're not like stuck at the monthly bills and, um, and it's the actual model provider itself. So you don't pay like that extra cost on top of the cursor ads to kind of, you know, source all the right models and that kind of stuff. But then you lose the advantage of the model swapping. But anyway, I'll put that aside because let's just, that's not the focus right now. However, what they've done is they've created something called Claude Agents and they are consistently just like the pioneers in the space, especially when it comes to agentic workflows, right? So that's kind of like AI agents that have access to tools, like a trigger tools, which is going to be the core of what you and I are developing over the next few months or slash weeks, right? Um, and they just, they released something called Claude Agents and as part of that, they basically put in a shit ton of work in finding the best way to structure that exact kind of file that you just referenced pretty much, which is this markdown file. So I want to share that with you now, and it gives you much better advice than I could in terms of how to structure it.

william: Um, just, just, sorry, so just want to jump in one quick. Maybe this is a question that you can answer after if you think it's more relevant. Sure. Um, I, uh, the last two weeks since Claude Code like has come out, people have been just been like, like simping over it, right?

alexander: They've been

william: thinking it's a bit like, it's amazing, it's the cursor killer, and they're just shitting on cursor, Claude Code's the new thing. Um, does this change? Like the only thing about Claude Code, correct me if I'm wrong, from my understanding, it only uses anthropic models. Yeah. Right?

alexander: Yeah, absolutely.

william: So you, you, you, you can't put in, you know, like all the other models, Chad's like opening eyes, you know, X's that grow, uh, Gemini, et cetera, right? That perplexity, it's not like that, correct?

alexander: Correct.

william: Okay. So then we're,

alexander: we're still on cursor. We're still on cursor. And I'll, I'll tell you why. There's a general rule where like, you should be building based off things that are not going to change. Like, don't try to predict what's going to change or what the future looks like, just try and like, be confident at what's not going to change in the next, like, two years, right? So what's not going to change, and I'm very confident in this, is the usage of model context protocols, MCPs, right? That seems like it's just going to be the HTTP, right, of the AI world, just like how HTTP is the website, is the HTTP of websites, right? So

william: build

alexander: around that protocol, because this is a protocol that all the agents are adopting, right? And every single tool is building into it, so everyone's investing heavily in it. The protocol is developing over time, it enables it to kind of like be standardized. So we shouldn't even be thinking about like cursor or clawed or whatever, right? And it doesn't mean we can't steal like good ideas from their frameworks. And that's what we're basically doing here with the sub -agents. Like they talk quite at length about what makes a good prompt for these types of sub -agents and, you know, what is like a long, what's too long, what's too short or whatever and why. So I just sent it to you on Slack, so go through that if you want to in your own time. And the fact of the matter is like cursor and clawed are both kind of developing the same things, right? So what we're doing here, what we're basically just defined is you've just defined an agent. Now, you define an agent in your markdown file I can see here. Well, actually, you're no longer sharing a screen, but you can send it to me if you want. You've defined an agent. So that's like the way that clawed defines it, which I think is a great definition, is personalities. You've defined a personality. You've defined an individual who has just like a different thinking process. Like between you and I, you'd probably be a lot better suited to be doing like copywriting and like reviewing content. And I'd be better suited at reviewing code, right? That just makes sense. So you're kind of tuning how the model works here. And I think like this is a pretty good job as a first draft. And we're going to basically create like a library of these guys. So you're going to create like a full task workforce of agents that we can use across clawed or cursor. It doesn't really matter to do different tasks. You're definitely going to have an agent for like the onboarding sequence, like a content strategist. You're going to have a copywriting agent. You're going to have a, you go more granular. You're going to have a Twitter writing agent, right? And they're all going to have like individual tools that are customized to them that they use and processes and workflows that we build into their personalities. So that's not going to change. I don't believe so. I think agents are here to stay and the way that we're kind of like tuning them are here to stay. And I think MCPs are here to stay. So let's build entirely around that and ignore cursor, ignore clawed code, build it in a way so it's agnostic, right? We can swap it out super quickly. That's, that's just my two pieces. Yeah,

william: I, I, I agree with that approach. Like basically what you're saying, if I try to break it down to like the most like bare bones version in this new, very, very fast paced, evolving world of AI, there is kind of, you break it down to there's constants and variables,

alexander: right?

william: Constants is what you're saying about like, you know, agents are here to stay. MCPs are here to stay. Variables are like, whether it's cursor, clawed code and stuff, those will change. Yeah,

alexander: like little granular things, right, where it's like, we don't want it to be designing anything that is like built into cursor and we don't want to be designing anything that's built into clawed code with like super specific functionality for each of them. Just like if it is able to communicate with an MCP and it has like customized personalities with different workflows we're working on, we're doing a great job and it's going to work across the board. So you can swap them out really quickly.

william: So clawed code, this thing you sent me here, I'll take a look at this. This is more of a reference of what clawed released on what the best practices are to, is it to actually create your own agent? I know this is probably clawed code in context of clawed code, correct?

alexander: Well, yes, in the context of clawed code, but cursor, by the way, are going to be copying clawed code. Clawed code's pretty much always the first one to do it. They're the ones who are behind MCP in the first place, right? And cursor have something very similar called cursor agents. And I think clawed code's documentation is just the most specific about what a good prompt looks like in order to define a personality or define an agent. So that's what I'm looking at this reference for. That's all. I wouldn't think about like the tools and shit. It doesn't really matter. I'm just like, just the promise.

william: It's just like the prior to the approach of it is like best practice. Just, it's basically like, like, this is how you follow like the best practice and creating your own personality of an agent.

alexander: Yeah, exactly. Absolutely.

william: Okay, cool. Understood. So then, so then like an action step on my end could be going back to basically, like, honestly, just throw, throw this, this, this link in, let's say, Chachi P2 or whatever. And then reference mine, it says, can you optimize this based on this article?

alexander: Sure. Yeah. I mean, that can definitely be a good strategy and like thinking as to why, but I mean, I think it's also important to like develop like the, the, the models, right? Like, look at, let's look at the document, do it really quickly now, right? Look at the documentation. Like, what is it doing in these prompts? If I mind, I'm going to share my screen with you if you're okay with that. Yeah, of course. Like, what is this prompt doing that I think is like really powerful, right? And it's like, where I can contrast it to you. So this is a code reviewer subagent. This is someone whose entire job is to review code. And like, look how clear this is. You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security. It's like vague enough, but also you understand it in one line. Like, you, you're not having to explain like what good code looks like. You're not having to like explain to them, you know, these really like niche kind of parameters that kind of locks them into it actually leads to like performance degradation because you lose generalizability. And so, and also, as I mentioned before, like, they're saying senior code reviewer, you're not just a code reviewer. That concept of hyperspace I introduced you to last week where it's like just saying you're the world's best software engineer will actually increase the output. Like, this is something that they've also built into this as well. Um, and then they're kind of like essentially giving it like workflows and what I think they do quite well is this idea of like defining very vague, like actionable steps. So if they wanted to think in a certain way, right, they give it like a workflow pattern, like analyze the messages, check this, check that, right? And they're also defining the tools it has access to, which I think is quite good. Um, and like they give me ideas of key practices, which I think is really powerful as well. And it's just like, it's clear to me that they are essentially trying to keep it to around a hundred words. So you kind of like preserve that generalizability and, and that like in a single line, you're kind of defining what it is, right? So if you look at like your, uh, I think you're sent to a notion. Okay, cool. So if you look at the actual agent persona, I think like you're actually very close to that in like already, to be honest with you, like you, you said very clearly in the first line, I mean, it's a bit longer, but it's still there, right? Like what you are, you're a master strategist, operate the intersection of brand psychology and AI driven marketing automation. And then you kind of gave it like those workflow steps to kind of define the parameters around. So it's kind of, it's, it's, uh, how do you say it's generalized enough that you're not forcing it down a single loophole in terms of how it thinks. Um, so I think like actual next step here is like, let's just try this for a little bit. But you're going to kind of get like a vibe of why, what you don't like about it. And we'll just simplify it based on the best standards that comes up with the cloud codes of agents.

william: Yeah. Okay. That sounds good. And, and, and yeah, I did take some time to, to kind of like really go back and forth. Like as simple as what that is, it took a while. I'm not saying, cause I'm just saying, uh, the reason I'm saying that is that, um, uh, just kind of pointing out that these small things that I like, I'll be honest. I took it for granted instructions. Like I used to do it and put it in the, uh, advocates and you can make instructions to your projects, but they weren't structured. They were like one paragraph of like what I want. Right. Yeah. Uh, or maybe one big paragraph of what I want, not structured in any sort of way. And I would just assume that it's better than just me going by default. Right. And, and it was, but, and I was telling Crystal this all over the weekend. It's like, if I had to change one thing now, just doing that exercise in the last year would be focus on instructions, like spend the time on instructions. Yeah. Cause like, I, I found that the outputs were significantly better. Um, oh, I'll also with this output, remember I told you, I, I, uh, I saw some posts, which I, I, I wanted to send you where someone kind of like wrote different prompts on, on, on different LLMs and how not to hallucinate. I actually took also, I OCR that post and implemented it into this, this, this persona. So anyways, it, it, it, it was good. It was a very good, um, it was a good exercise. And I think it did dramatically increase the outputs. Um, now what I was doing in here, let me show, do you have access to my notion? I think, I think they gave you access

alexander: to the, the, I have action to like the non -citizen AI workflow page.

william: Yeah. Yeah. Do you, do you see the, like the pages there of all like the subpages? They're not very organized. I just threw in the pages here as thing will probably organize this better, but, um, okay. What, what was, okay. So prompt history, there is, oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. So go, go to prompt history.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Uh, I, I was just kind of logging, uh, things, right? So what, this is, this is what I was doing. Um, so there's, there's two things. One is that for brand, brand fundamentals, really you need to, oh, and this is also a good pushback, um, that, that, that, um, that the agent did when I was kind of using the same kind of instructions for just kind of going over a few things is that, um, brand fundamentals, you need a human, uh, you can probably extract a lot without a human, right? Just based on like what's already covered publicly on websites and resources, blog articles, you know, et cetera. But for example, mission vision, right? It, you can, you can get the LLMs to maybe get great, give you some great hallucinations of maybe probable, this kind of sounds like a good mission statement for a brand, but really that has to come from the actual founder or the exact sort of CL, whoever, right? Like, like all the stuff you can get still a lot out of it, right? And I spent probably two hours on. So when I say here, this, this is kind of those for me, first prompt, this took eight iterations tested to generate a good prompt. I, I did eight, eight different, eight prompts. This one, this prompt here was an evolution,

alexander: right? Okay.

william: On how to get brand fundamentals. And I was using this in cursor and I would do it so that, um, uh, for every prompt I would do, um, a new session. So that there's no biases of the other session, et cetera. Right. So it was a clean session. Sure. Um, and I got it down. So this was the one where it, it started to give me. Some like really good, um, like outputs, this prompt right here. Now there's a few things about this one. And I want to go over with you because, um, let me share my screen.

alexander: I'm

william: going to share my entire screen here.

UNKNOWN: Okay.

william: So here's my cursor so that I, where was it? So, all right, I know I was doing competitive analysis. Yeah. There you got a lot to cover your zing. So, okay. This is the marketing persona. This is what I showed you in Notion. Sure. I know we had LLM guidelines. I, I changed this to false. I'll always apply. Um, and then I made this one true. So this is correctly set up, right? It, it, it should technically now use this. Sure.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Yeah.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Okay. Okay. So this, this is, that's it for that. And then, um, where was it? Was that,

alexander: there was one here. Do you feel, do you feel like it's using it or do you feel like it's not using it?

william: I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm not sure. Um, that I'm not sure. That's the thing. Because you have

alexander: pretty actionable ways for it to act. Right. So if you're not really feeling like it's using it, then it might not be using it. So we can, we can diagnose that very quickly if you want.

william: Yeah. Well, like for example, this right here, right. It says like this thing thing that like, if, if something is, um, if something is highly probable, which I think a lot of it, their outputs are just like, again, it's, it's, it's just highly, you know, these alarms are highly probable, uh, hallucinations. Right. Sure. There's something that's like kind of more like low probability that can still have connecting, you know, kind of some connecting patterns is speculation. I didn't see this, these types of tags, but maybe this is just how the prompt is. Maybe it's just not understanding this point. I mean, we have to make this more clear. I'm not sure. Right. But that's, that's, that's like a small detail. Like this is just like one part. The one thing I want to, okay, prompt one, friend fundamentals. So, yeah. So yeah, I labeled this prompt one. Um, yeah. So this, this was the output, right?

alexander: This is using, uh, the tools, right? You're allowing it to use the tools.

william: Yeah. So, so for example, if you go here, this was my prompt and I believe this is, this is the same prompt. This is the version eight I showed you in the Notion that I, I, I logged. Yeah. And then, um, yeah, then it, it only, it didn't use perplexity. It just used fire call and it did it multiple times. And then it gave me this, um, which, yeah.

alexander: Where do you, like, what are the weaknesses? What are the strengths in, in this output?

william: Sorry, what is this?

alexander: What are the weaknesses and what are the strengths in this output?

william: Sorry, sorry. So, you know what, this was a competitive analysis when I was doing it. Like, uh, this was different. This is, this is actually another thing. I'm trying to find, let me, I probably read fundamentals. Okay. So no, I need to, I need to label this better. Uh, oh, hold on. Sorry, let me, let me see if I have it here. Output history. Yeah, this, this is it. I, I copy and pasted here, but I'm pretty sure I had it in person. Let me try. I'm like, okay, deep, deep analysis has to be one of these. I think this is one that we did together where it is, to be honest. Anyways, this, I copy and pasted this. Um, this was pretty good. Right. But there's a few things, right? Like, let me just, let me, let me, uh, like, for example, you see here, mission and vision. Right. Um, it says Akavi's mission is to them, uh, democratize a data sovereignty, enabling a world where all sass to live on chain, excelling humanity's advancements through the power of data. Sure. And then a world of warehouse, which has changed. Yeah. So it did do that. We believe in a world. There was something here that was a bit of a 10 year vision. Future vision. In 10 years, Akavi's vision is a world where all transactions are verifiable. Yeah, okay, now I know there was something else here, but overall here, this, this was okay. This was, this was actually quite good. Um, I wasn't actually, it wasn't this right here. What was the issue was my competitor analysis. So, so let me, so I did something else, right? I was, I was then focusing on competitor analysis and I was, I was kind of messing around with like, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, should it be for each prompt for competitor analysis, it should be one session, one competitor. It shouldn't be, let's say like, here are the five competitors and here's my, my product, like, like, here's my output. I mean, like, like, give me an output to all, to all five competitors.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it depends on the, uh, on the depth that you want to have, right? So if you were to just name the five competitors, you told to use perplexity research or fire crawl, it'll do all the one prompt or one kind of session. And that can be, you know, quite, quite good and it's a good starting place, but if you want to go more deep in it, yeah, then definitely one by one at a time is going to be the best and maybe kind of take all five of the reports and then turn them into one single one.

william: Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's where, let me just, let me just, let me just show you, show you this right here. So this is my, what I have to, I have to, I have to, I have to double check basically. Like I was putting this, I was, I was testing this with a deep research from GROK or GROK and then, and then putting this and I felt GROK had a better, um, had a better response. But the question is this, right, is that the outputs here are very concise if I, like, is there, is there some sort of, let's say, um, way to, let's say, make it more in depth. I guess what I'm trying to say is like, I don't know what's going on under the hood. I know it's searching for fire crawl.

alexander: Sure. Yeah. If you scroll down there when you open it. So like these. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Scroll down or like go into the, you'll see the actual context to get access to. But, um, yeah, I mean, this is kind of where the power of like examples, like come in later on. And then obviously in the prompting being like quite specific as to what you want, uh, as well as like the agent, um, the agent specifications. So if you, for the research stuff, like your preference for, um, like very detailed reports, then, then I think clarifying that in the prompt will probably be the best case, like quickest win. Um, and your agent just say like, you know, you're much more detail oriented and you don't really create bullet points and you focus more on like detailed research reports that will also change its behavior. Um, I do know that models by default are trained to be much more concise because people hate it. When you ask like a single like question that required like five words and it came out of the fucking like report. So you have to kind of push them to be more detailed.

william: So, so for this, for example, right, where like you've got messaging and telling where this has not available. Right. Which is good in the sense that it's not just hallucinating, but I guess this stuff is not scrapable. Right. Whether it's headline, but like, this is very flat, I feel writing style. Yeah. It's very concise. Um, I suppose the question is, how do you want to approach this right now? The brand fundamentals actually was quite good. They, that when I got to a version eight, it was decent. There was one or two things, which I'm, I wish I wrote down, but it was overall pretty good.

UNKNOWN: Mm -hmm .

william: The next step is like competitor analysis. Kind of like, just to give you a higher level. Let me, let me go back. Stop sharing. Just to kind of like explain it. Um, you got brand fundamentals. And then once you get brand fundamentals, um, there still has to be this human in the loop, both for the marketer and also the execs to kind of like confirm and verify and to get told in some blanks. Um, that's one thing. And then you got competitor analysis, right? Why competitor analysis for me comes before content generation is that, um, understanding, let's say your core, maybe four or five competitors. You understand how they position themselves compared to, you know, like, like, um, the brand that you're working with. What, what is it say the enemies, right? Or let's say the pain points that they're solving. What are maybe the vulnerabilities or weaknesses, which the competitor analysis, like with the good profit. I've done in the past where it's able to identify some, some good insights around analyzing, you know, the messaging, what, what they, they, how they communicate, you know, what they're communicating, what, what their product offering is, et cetera. And see how Akave can come in and remedy that, or let's say be different from that. Right. And serve, right. Those, those pain points, uh, in a way that those competitors are not doing, um, that, that provides good insight on how to approach content generation. Right. At least one component of that. Right. So this is the main goal. We've got competitors for Akave. Let's say there's, there's actually more than, than five, cause we've got web two and web three, but I have like five. Walrus, the one that I was kind of doing is kind of one on the web three side and they're kind of more, maybe a direct competitor in some way. If we were to like, do this where we, okay. So what's the process? Understand the competitor. What, how do you understand the competitor? Website, blog material. Um, maybe news, uh, if there's any news PR around it. And then there's a component of, uh, Twitter, which we don't have that MCP right now. Right. To scrape Twitter. Uh, scraping Twitter is a good way to, because, you know, it's good to understand again, probably better to understand, uh, tone of voice, uh, and how they're actually communicating to their audience. You get clues, not say clues, but you kind of get a good understanding of who their audience is, which is not like the most insightful thing. Cause obviously the audience is kind of obvious in the space or in this category. Um, but you also understand, uh, let's say partnerships and updates that, you know, not, are not necessarily going to be found on websites or blogs. Usually like those updates for blogs are from big partnerships, but there's also pretty decent partnerships and ecosystem, like growth that's happening. That's just, that's living on their Twitter feed and not on their website.

alexander: Right. Do you, do you care more about what their content is engaging with? So like what, you know how I had the EVS score before the engagement value score. Do you care more about what content they're putting out and what's engaging with the audience or just like you want to analyze all their content and just know what the entire landscape looks like for them in terms of what they're trying.

william: Yeah. So I, I guess the first question that comes to mind is a timeline, right? I'm like how, like, like what, what is the window in which we gather that data? Right. Is it from the beginning of time from their feed or to, to now, or is there like a, like a window? I think the beginning of time is maybe too much. I mean, that that's obviously ideal, but maybe it's not that necessary. Sure. Maybe it's more like, um, maybe like it's like, you know, one year. Right. You know, uh, the question for you is, is one year a lot. If someone, if the cadence someone's posting, I know what Walrus is, which also would be a good, a good insight to have in terms of competitive analysis on the social front. What's their cadence, right? How many posts a week? Is it a post a week? Is it twice a day? Is it, you know, seven to 14, whatever it is, right? Um, can we get, let's say, let's say just, just for easy numbers here. It's a post a day. It's probably a bit more for Walrus than some other ones are more active. That's 365 posts, right? A year. Is that a lot of posts to scrape?

alexander: No, no, no, no, not at all. I mean, it's, it's pretty cheap. I just, my, um, my Twitter scraper, the one that I mentioned on my Twitter account was like, I think it was something like, uh, a thousand tweets for like 15 cents.

william: Oh,

alexander: wow.

william: It's amazing.

alexander: Yeah. It was, it was something we just checked, but it was something really, uh, like ridiculously cheap. Um, and then, yeah, you scraped it all the context. And as I mentioned before, the workflow that I made was like calculating, um, different scores, all that kind of stuff. So let me just check, uh, very quickly and just make sure that I'm not lying to you. Yeah. And what the profiles across X and all. Okay. It's called Twitter, Twitter API .io pricing. Uh, yeah. Okay. 15, 15 cents per a thousand tweets. Um, and is that,

william: is that the Appify integration you're mentioning?

alexander: Uh, actually this one isn't the Appify. This is actually a third party API, which I found to be better and cheaper and more consistent than the Appify. Um, okay. Okay. But yeah, 15 ,000 per 1 ,000 tweets. And then you can, you can, you could actually scrape their followers and the profiles that use that follow them as well. All that kind of stuff. Right. So you get as granular as you want. Um,

william: could you, could you scrape the media as well?

alexander: Yeah. Well, that was what my whole workflow did.

william: So like, like, does it get a lot more expensive if you scrape the media and does that, does that count? I guess that counts as part of the cost, which is not a big deal. It sounds like it's cheap anyways. This isn't that. So let's say, you know, whatever it is, can it actually scrape? Cause sometimes the media has, um, like text on it. And some of that text is, is pretty good. Like it's pretty insightful sometimes even more so than the post itself. Sure. Right. So, um, can it, can it OCR the media and then yeah, OCR and understand it.

alexander: Um, so let me just show you this, what I did for my air table integration for my analysis. And this was really actually quite good. It was super insightful. Um, okay, cool. So it defined the media type, uh, if it's a text video photo. So that's the kind of media that was involved within it. Uh, if there was any media in it that I extended the, um, the, uh, workflow. So that was able to actually create a full transcript of it. So if it was an image, for example, it'll talk to you like about the image, like what's actually happening in the image. What's like, what's it was a showing. And then if it's a video, I structured it. So it, um, has a full detailed breakdown of the events.

william: Oh my God. So, so you've done this.

alexander: Yeah. It's already done. It's already done.

william: Amazing.

alexander: Amazing. If I like, let me, uh, paste this. So here we go. Here's, uh, show you this. Sorry. I'll take it out of the, of your notion page, but I just already have it up. So it takes, it breaks it down by a transcript as well. So you have like the timing of the video. It tells you what's, what's happening, what's happening on the screen. What, like what, what's being said in terms of like the actual, um, like words and stuff as well. So you get a full broken down transcript of the video as well.

william: So, so basically like the idea, like the core fundamental idea is that like, you know, there's something about scraping, scraping text, which is great. But can you, can you create it? So you scrape it and have the LL actually understand it, not just about the text, but also the media. It sounds like you've done this. This

alexander: is what this

william: is. Yeah.

alexander: That's what it is.

UNKNOWN: Yeah.

william: Okay. Okay. That's awesome. Okay. That's good. So we're, we're definitely on the same wavelength in terms of, I mean, okay, that's, that's really good. Sure.

alexander: Okay. I mean, so you, you gained so much more context, right? Because I mean, what I already found, there's loads of analysis you do, right? Like what I did, and I'll send you the video of, of me actually explaining it. Cause I go like five minutes through the video. Um, it's pretty bad video. Yeah. Again, I'm, I'm, I'm learning. Um, but you have the ability to perform general analysis within your niche. Right. So, you know, what type of content resonates and like what, what I think is quite intuitive in terms of this type of analysis of what works. What doesn't work is you calculate the engagement value score. Right. Um, you take the top 10 % because you can assume that in your context window, you can generally get maybe like 50 tweets in, including all the transcripts, most likely 25, whatever. Right. You take the top ones, the mediocre ones and the bad performing ones. And then you kind of like do analysis all three and you compare and contrast and you'll start to identify patterns. And like what was immediately evident for me in my niche was that, you know, visual formats was by far the best performing content. And like there was a super aggressive, I think I told you this early on, it's a bit awkward, but like there's a super aggressive, like anti -agency positioning and anti monthly subscription positioning that really resonated with the audience. Like for the type of people that I was trying to target, which, uh, I didn't really like dive too deeply as to why that's the case. Um, I have a suspicion, but yeah, like that's why I like, I learned something about my audience, which was important to me. And then I was trying to extend it in such a way so that I can perform another workflow that scrapes like Twitter templates. Right. So I started extracting like, like a template that worked, which was like a video on one side photo, which was a screenshot of some sort of prompt or workflow. And then like a quick caption, like as a template, I was extracting the high performing templates, putting into a template library and then trying to find a content system to capture that. And like, you know, churn it all out pretty much is, is what I was working on. So yeah.

william: Okay. That's good. That's good. That's good insight. So, um, okay. So this is definitely possible. And was it a lot more like, were there any bottlenecks or strains, like in terms of like getting them? Cause it like, for example, you know, scraping, let's say, you know, twice a day for a year, you know, 700, 800, you know, tweets, uh, like, like in general media, tweets, et cetera. Um, let's, let's call it, let's call it a dollar. I'm not focusing on price because it's so cheap. It doesn't really matter, but getting that information, you know, putting it on the air table. So like, I guess like, like, I think that should be the next step. I think there's maybe two things. One is she, is there any questions on brand fundamentals? There was one thing, but I think it was okay. I think it was maybe it was concise by brand fundamentals. Extraction with that prompt was good. It was straight to the, which is good. Right. But the question is that like, why, why was it so concise? Maybe, maybe, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. Right. Maybe I'm, I'm used to just whether it's chat GPT cloud or Gemini giving me a little bit more, more meat on it. And again, I'm not saying, you know, brevity is king. Right. Especially in this where, you know, Texas commoditized now. So I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I just want to understand why that is.

alexander: Yeah. I mean, I think it's again, like threefold. Firstly, you don't use perplexity. Perplexity does really, really good research for you. And you have to be quite explicit in the prompt to use perplexity MCP and fire crawl MCP. And like be explicit as to when you use what. Right. So if you're trying to get like a general overview and like perform some sort of competitive research, I would always use like lean towards perplexity. Fire crawl is much for get, for getting like content from the website itself and scraping the website itself. So that you are a hundred percent confident that the information you're getting is from the website. Right. So it was like, they kind of both play a role in this, uh, in this research process. And I, I, it wasn't using perplexity. So it can only build what it knew about the company off the website. Um, like the second thing is like the prompt itself needs to be quite explicit. And like, this is where we get into like this quickly evolves down the line of you kind of iterate through the prompt. So like I would get that output that you have right there. I would say, not bad. Good start. Let's use the perplexity MCP to expand on this. I don't like how like it's too, like there's too much brevity involved. Like, let's try and make it a little bit more detailed and kind of like, you know, it's an agent. You can have a back and forth conversation with it. You don't have to have a one off perfect prompt. And then what you basically do is you, once you're really happy with it, which might take you like five to six back and forth, which is completely fine. You just take it as an example and you put it into like an example folder. And then next time you do it with a third party one, right? You have like an improved prompt because you know what you like. And then you just say like an example of a very good analysis is this. And you literally just frame the example and you pull in the example and you're going to get, you'll be shocked by the improvement in terms of the output that it gets because examples are by far the cheapest and best way to improve the quality of your outputs.

william: Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's good to know. So, so based on that, should we go back to the brand fundamentals? Look into the, cause I didn't, I didn't, I, it'll use fire calls. Right. And I, and the reason why I didn't say use perplexity, cause I was under the impression that the agent knows which tool to use, but maybe it'll default to fire call because for whatever reason. But you're saying for things like that, we should add perplexity to that.

alexander: Yeah. I mean, like the context window is big again, a hundred thousand, like, let's not like try and push the context window too much, but you could definitely be very confident in everything being taken to context. When you have like a back and forth conversation that includes like 30 tool calls and then like, you know, five or six back and forth. So you can be extremely confident that everything is being taken to account and being assessed properly. Right. So I wouldn't fear just hitting back and being quite clear and just thinking like what you don't like about it. And then you kind of like getting it to that point because you kind of want to get as many examples of good usage as possible pretty much. Right. And then by the way, you're going to see by that example of, and like, you're just going to sit there for like five, like five seconds and just be like, what do I like about this? Like, why is it good? And then you just turn that, you keep the example and like, then you just turn like it into a prompt itself. Right. Like if you saw that your example had like a thousand words that maybe you could literally say in the prompt or like, what do you think the MCP researcher did for perplexity that improved it? And just say that in the prompt. Like, yeah, use perplexity research. We're trying to get a broad overview of the industry because it's going to take into account articles and all that kind of stuff as well. Right. Which is not on the website. It doesn't need to scrape it. Um, and, uh, yeah, like that's, that's kind of like the best way to work through this is kind of just like to just push through it and, and use the models to their full capacity and just save it. Like the main goal here doing all this within your cursor ID is that you can just have like a fucking file system to your left. You just jump things in, drop things in. Right. Right. And my responsibility here like lies in figure out a way to systemically structure your file system so that you're able to kind of do more complex workflows down the line. And that's not chaos. Cause right now, like, you know, I had the exact same problem as you. I was using it. I fell in love with the whole, like, you know, framing like the agents and all that kind of stuff. And just doing like at this file, but your workflows and the output you're generating quickly exceeds the like structure of just dropping all the files into a single thing. So you kind of have to structure in a certain way. And I'm working on that at the moment. I should have something to show you hopefully by tomorrow or by Wednesday, which I think is going to significantly improve the process. And yeah, I mean, I think just getting examples is, is, is by far the best approach here.

william: Okay. Okay. So what should we, should we focus on the brand fundamentals and do the perplexity thing, or should I mess around with that? Or should we focus on the competitor analysis? And, and, and the competitor analysis is more about how do we make sure that like, for example, one competitor for a copy is Walrus. I did something for it. It's okay. Um, can we make it better? Right. The quality of the outputs is going to be the quality of like how we analyze it and therefore the quality of how we create content for it, like in general. So, uh, what, what, what do you think is more, um, like what, what, where should we start off? Competitor analysis or go back to brand fundamentals and, and kind of augment that.

alexander: I think competitor analysis would be the best place to kind of start off and like, get to a point where you're really, really happy with it. Um, sorry, sorry, my other way around, but brand fundamentals, I apologize. Um, because that is going to significantly improve downstream workflows, which would be competitor analysis and the output. Yeah. And you're going to sort of see how they kind of like are attached to each other.

UNKNOWN: And, uh, yeah.

william: Okay. So, so then, um, okay, so here's my cursor. This actually, I do believe this is the best, this was prompt on brand fundamentals. This was good. Like, I mean, there was one thing I said, but you know, let's say it was, it's, it's all good. I think it's relatively accurate. It didn't use perplexity though. Right. Do I, and I, I, I pasted this frontier. Um, this, this is, this is like a markdown. So how do you want to approach it? Should I search for the history here or make a new session?

alexander: Um, I mean, what would be best is the kind of final session that led to this output because it's all in complex anyway. If that's not possible, then we should have reference it and say like, Hey, we want to expand on this compare analysis on this brand fundamentals. I would actually reference the template as well that you, you, you put out. Did you do that by the way, where you, you put in like the templates and you say, Hey, this is kind of like what I want to be outputted. Cause you.

william: Yeah. In, in ocean, I copy and pasted that. Like I, I, I did the most updated prompt to get this.

alexander: Okay.

william: Uh, and then that was the note where it's like, this, this took me eight, this was eight times to get to this prompt. Like eight iterations. Gotcha.

alexander: Gotcha. Um, yeah, I, I guess kind of just be like super clear. So like what you don't like about it. Right. And like, let's just say like, don't like you use perplexities, MCP. Um, and also I think one thing you mentioned before, and you seem to be struggling a little bit with, which is like not having access to the citations. We could totally ask for it to put citations in here. Like where did they get it? So if you just like quickly want to proof check, proofread it, you can, it just drops the citations. And it gives you an idea of the information sources that are valuable in this field space.

william: So, yeah, that, that was actually like in prompts three or four when I was like debating. Cause like, the thing is, is this, right? I'm like, okay. Um, fire crawl and scrapes basically literal context. Right. Um, uh, and then it's supposed to. You know, provide me some sort of output. Right. Sure. And I actually had to change the, the, the personality of my, um, of the marketing persona, the agent persona, because at first it was like super rigid as like your data, like analyst or like a market analyst. Right. And then I was going on chat GPT, kind of asking it like, should it be analysts or should be strategists? And they got, it gave me an interesting kind of response, which I didn't really consider too much, is that even by switching analysts versus strategists gives you a much difference. Output. And the reason why is because analysts are very much like hard data, like, you know, very objective based, like, you know, to the true or false, or this is it. Whereas strategists, it has a little bit more creative license to still take data, but kind of connect the dots. Sure. Right. And, and if, if you start to do it, say, um, more like brand strategists or sort of like more brand strategist outputs, but call it an analyst, you're not going to get that creativity. It's going to be super literal and it's just not going to give you, it's not going to connect the dots as, as good as a strategist rule, you know?

UNKNOWN: Yeah. Right.

william: So strategists kind of like, you have to kind of give them that little bit of like wiggle room to kind of hallucinate to a point where it's like high probability stuff. Whereas analysts are very factual. And, and my prompt was like, you know, if you don't have the answer, just, you don't have the answer. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I, I, my outputs reflected that like in the beginning was like, they weren't, they were just like, we don't have the answer to this or blah, blah, blah. It was just, it was also very stale or very, very. Yeah. It was just very, it was, it was not wrong. It was just not, um, it didn't connect the dots as good. How

alexander: do you feel about these workflows that kind of have like a, the, the human in the loop aspects to it?

william: I, I think it's, I mean, especially for marketing, it's necessary. It's absolutely necessary. Um, it, the, the, for me, it's not about trying to completely remove the human in the loop. I don't think it's at least now. I don't think, I think it's, I think anyone who tries to like remove that part is going to create like a soulless brand or soulless content or just inaccurate. Content in general.

alexander: Right. Yeah. Right.

william: So like

alexander: how much off the back of an insight that pulled out, like literally that chat interface, you kind of like respond to it and be like, oh, this is an interesting insight and kind of like tailor your next response based off the insight to like dive deeper into it or something.

william: I, so good question. This was purely what I did was that I, I wasn't talking back at my sessions are, are, was not me going back and forth. Right. What I was doing is this was, was basically how can I create a really good prompt, very specific based on brand fundamentals. And how do I get it? So that it gives me that maybe 70 or maybe 80 % starting point. Right. And then it's human to loop 30 % refining. And then maybe, but I wasn't doing that. Like I didn't go back, like those eight iterations of prompts was purely one shot. How can I get my prompt at that 80, 70 to 80 % point.

alexander: Right. Sure. So

william: this is what you're seeing here. Yeah. So I also did new sessions for each one. Right. And the reason why is because, cause I was, I was talking to ChatGPT as well on, on like, what is the, like, if, if I continue the same session, then you've got this kind of session bias, whatever, like the, there's probably another word for it. Um, but, but either way, the, the, the, the core of the principle is that it's going to be like, and I've, I've been victim of this many times, not realizing it in the past. Now I'm, I'm more aware of it is that, you know, ChatGPT is very prone to biases, especially as you, you talk to it. It's super, it's super sensitive to it. Unless you kind of tell it otherwise. Right.

UNKNOWN: Yeah.

william: Even then sometimes it kind of like, you know, slips. Sure. I think. Anyways, the point I'm trying to make is that this was my thing. Prompt number one, let's get brand fundamentals in one go. I did it. Prompt wasn't good. Output wasn't very good. Went back. I, I basically what I did was I pasted the output to ChatGPT as like my prompt. I'd say like helper or like, like, like let's say guide. And then here's my output, blah, blah, blah. This is what I don't like about it, blah, blah, blah. And then it would either agree or blah, blah, blah. And it did, typically did agree. It's like, yeah, I have to change your prompt. It would make a new prompt. I'd, I'd see it and maybe add a few things. New session on cursor. It's prompt number two. Output was maybe better, but still not on the mic. Right? I told ChatGPT, let's modify it to this. This is what I don't like about it. This is all, et cetera. I did this until I got to like prompt it.

UNKNOWN: Gotcha.

william: This output was like, okay. Yeah, that's good. But new session, no talking to cursor. Right? It was more about like, like one shot. How close to like a final product can I get? Knowing it's not going to be that way. But getting to a point where like, can I get it to 80%, right?

alexander: Was the goal time saving or were you kind of like trying to find the best prompt?

william: It was, it was not like the, the way it's the goal. Oh, we missed it. We missed the goal. Are you talking about the goal, just like the future goal or the goal for this? The

alexander: goal in this case, like the work, the kind of like the eight iterations you did, where you just try to find like a really good prompt to get you, as you just mentioned, to the 80 % mark in the first shot, pretty much.

william: For time saving just for future work. Yes. Yeah.

alexander: Right.

william: So, so I can be confident that like, I got, and who knows, like this is, this is for this client. Who knows? Maybe a new, like, like a, like a new client with a new category and new things. Maybe I still have to go through that rabbit hole. I'm not sure. Right. But the, but, but my hope is, is that I spent that, that, that activity I'm just telling you right now, easily was two hours. Easily. Maybe two and a half hours, right. Going back and forth. Right. Which is fine. That's good. I'd rather do the work now, do it well now, knowing that I have the confidence later on. So I can use these prompts, use this for a post.

alexander: Yeah.

william: And I don't have to do those. Like it'll dramatically save time.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah.

william: So the goal was to save time, but it's not saving time just to take a saving time and then trading off quality. Right. Like quality always is number one. There's, there's no, it's like a non -negotiable. Gotcha.

alexander: Yeah. I mean, so I would push back and basically say, like, I follow, this is becoming less and less common because people, like, are kind of realizing the agentic way is the much better approach. Like prompting competitions. Like prompting competitions. People like actually have competitions, like write the best prompts pretty much. Right. And this girl invented this prompt, prompt framework called the star method. Um, and the entire idea of the star method is this idea of setting a goal. Like initially, like, I don't know if you were going to therapy or if you were like, like out of some sort of session or sort of like professional, they would always be like, okay, the goal of this session is to achieve X. And we don't really care what kind of like way we get to it, but we want to get to it. Right. So I think a good way to approach this, um, and to also achieve the objective you're looking forward, which is to get to the 80 % mark. As I mentioned before, like in the initial prompt, outline the template that you want to kind of have filled out. And also just say like, that is the objective. The objective is that we have like a really well designed, like fun about brand fundamentals markdown file that is aligned with this template, like not a hundred percent, but inspired by this template. Right. And these are tools we have at disposal. This is kind of how I want you to approach these things. This is kind of how you want your responses to be. Let's get to that. So you're going to lose like initially the first kind of, uh, 50, 70 % mark that you're looking for, getting a one go. But over the course of like five to six kind of responses back and forth to that single chat session, you're going to get to like a really good output, which you're going to be like, okay, this is really aligned for what I want. As mentioned before, then you save as an example. And then you analyze that example to look at like what was really good about it. And then you put that into the prompt. That's how you kind of get to what you're trying to do it in like a better way. So that after that two hour session, next time you actually do have an example, you have a prompt and you actually have a really good output that you can use. And like, you should, we should just do follow that method for the next workflows that we have coming down as well. Um, and just give that a try, because I think that's going to achieve that objective one much quicker and more effectively.

william: Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm, I'm kind of, I always say I'm, I'm 100 % there with the prompt with the output. I'm, I'm the only thing that's missing is, and maybe just more of a curiosity thing. If I had perplexity in the mix, for example, would this response be any better? Or maybe it wouldn't, maybe it's just, just more words, but it does not have more impact. That's what I'm curious

alexander: about. I think asking for citations, right? A citation could also be like, where on the website did it find it? If it's using fire crawl.

william: Right. But the thing is, so with this for citations, some of you can have citations, uh, but some it's like, it's basically connecting dots together. Sure. Right. Yes. Like there's also for a copy cloud. Now there's not that much information on it. So that's why like a lot of this stuff is, cause I also went to one thing I was doing too. Oh yeah. Here's, here's, here's, here's a good example of this. Because one of my challenges or the problems was that there, there's not an abundance on the comedy cloud. Cause they could, I told you they, a new product, comedy cloud versus a comedy network. They kind of separate things. They just saw, launched that comedy cloud. Um, I'm like, okay. In the beginning it wasn't giving me a lot at all. I'm like, okay, well there is ways where you can kind of extrapolate what the service offerings are and understand with those service offerings, why those service offerings, uh, those service offering offerings exist for customers. Right. So for example, like for a copy, you know, they're like, like this cloud solution, fully managed and SD compatible, lower costs, better control, built in resilience, programmable policy enforcement. Right. All this stuff they can start to like understand. Okay. Like compared to all the other cloud services, for example, like, you know, better control, like, no, let's say like, like, like, like fees to have your data and access your data, like other enterprise cloud services. What are the pain points based on that? Right. It's not explicitly said on the website per se. Okay. In some ways, sometimes they are, but it's more about like, you know, if this is that, and this is that, therefore it should be this.

alexander: Right. So

william: it's kind of had this experience.

alexander: So you're shouting out like the, the, it's like the, like the deductive reasoning of the model pretty much that you're trying to extrapolate. Okay, cool. That's fine. Yeah. Um, so there's a few ways you can approach this, which, which, which is really interesting. Okay. So firstly, I think the citation stuff should, is, is important for like facts that's extracted. Right. So you can say that in the prompt. Like if you've got something from an article, an insight from article or a source or whatever, like shout it out, put the citation to get a deductive reasoning process to work better, like a lot better. There's like a prompting trick that I really like, um, is to have it explain its reasoning as to why that it made that insight. Right. So you have it go like for every insight that's using deductive reasoning or whatever it's connected dots. Do you want to call it explain, like provide the reasoning as to why you made that insight. Right. Yeah. And then within that provision of reasoning, explain how it's aligned with like the, like the objective of what we're trying to get from this. Right. And it's weird because it's kind of like, you know, when you have like, you're a kid, you're a teacher, like a student and, uh, it asks you to show you proof of work. And it just makes you think like cognitively in a different way. And it's like, okay, like how do I actually get to this answer? I know this answer to be true. Maybe let me expand on like how it gets the answer. Like it outlines this reasoning process. It significantly improves the firstly, the insight that actually gets in the end, because it means that it's like actually like think itself through and it improves the understandability from your perspective. You get an insight as to like it's thinking process and you might, that might inspire some sort of third party, like down the line, like, you know, a response or something. So I think that's your prompt. It's going to help you kind of win both of those battles. I would say.

william: Okay. That that's actually, I really like that. I think that's, that's okay. I, I, I 100 % agree with that. Um, so two things you said, one is when there is a source to cite, cite the source. Yeah. And for each, let's say category or section of this, have, let's say, it doesn't have to be a long paragraph or maybe a bullet points. Right. Insights. Right. And deduce the reasoning of how you arrived to this or like, you know, the backing or the deductions around that.

alexander: Yeah, exactly. Okay. Ask it to explain itself pretty, pretty much. Right. If we're just playing the output game, it's actually like up to you to deduce it. Right. And like, you need to make sure you're aligned with what the model is thinking, which is again, why you and I both really liked the first, the feature on cursor where you can just toggle the thinking process open. It's like, okay, the user asked me for this. And like so many times I've caught it where it's like going down this reasoning chain. And I was like, no, fuck. That's like not at all what I'm looking for. Like, I don't want you to be thinking that kind of reasoning process at all. So, you know, what do I need to change my prompt? And you're, you're going to see something there to see what's in line with it.

william: Yeah. I'm just, I'm, I, as you speak, I'm just writing this down from a notes to two as action items to do. Cause I, I think those are really great. Um, that's really great, great feedback. And I think that's maybe that's one part that's missing that can make this stronger too. Right.

alexander: It

william: also gives us a clarity and confidence on, on, on the outputs in itself.

alexander: Yeah. I, I, so I would say like actually the three things I would add is the citations, the reasoning, and then also the explicitness of the goal that you want to achieve and what tools it has access to. Right. That's going to allow you to use perplexity and do not shy away from the, you know, back and forth conversations that the agents allow you to have until you get really good output. Um, that can, can we,

william: can we, uh, actually, I'm going to go to my notion thing right now. We don't, I, I could do it in my own time. Cause I know this is sometimes takes time. I don't want to go on the nitty gritty here, but here we've got rule of objective, right? So I, I, I do have this, but what I don't have, which, what you're saying is I'm going to write down a separate thing here is, um, is tools available.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Um, so how, okay. So by default, it seems like, you know, cursor and this whole thing really likes using fire crawl. No, I, I, none of, it never used perplexity. Right.

alexander: No.

william: How do I, um, what, what do I say for it? Like, like if I just say you got fire crawl perplexity, but it, it, maybe, I don't know, maybe it will still use fire crawl unless I give specific instructions or should I give specific instructions to use perplexity?

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I would shout out, I think already saying that, you know, fire crawl and perplexity are at your disposal and like fire crawl, use it for like scraping websites and perplexity for like general research will, it'll get you there pretty much to be honest with you. Um, it is kind of annoying. Cause like the whole point of MCPs is that you should be like very clear what tools are available to you suppose. They should reason as to what tools are available to you suppose. Well, I've just found that in practice, you know, one's theory and one's practice. In practice, you just do want to shout it out in the prompt because that almost ensures 100 % of the time it's going to use the right, the right, uh, tool.

william: So, so it's just shouting it out, but not actually saying use perplexity to go dive deeper after you use fire crawl. Not

alexander: like,

william: not that specific.

alexander: Don't have to be that specific. I think just literally shouting it out is going to kind of push it to use both. Right. Um, okay. Yeah. I mean, this is something I'm tackling with that kind of like framework that I'm building out, uh, internally into cursor. It's like, there's loads of ways to improve this, but like really the name of the game just comes down to like a good prompt, a good personality associated to it that you're happy with how the, um, yeah, the output is, is aligned. Um, and like, uh, examples and like, that's just going to be so fucking far. And then the whole point again is put in the file system, you know, you, there's no, uh, compare analysis about brand fundamentals. Uh, there's no content strategy without compare analysis and brand fundamentals. There's like dependencies, right? So what I was really struggling with when I was doing this internally was like, if I changed my brand fundamentals for whatever reason off the back of a call with a client or whatever, the dependencies, which is pair analysis and content strategy didn't change. They were all like disconnected from each other. Right. So it was like, they're all interlinked. Um, so, I mean, I'm sorry, I'm just thinking out loud now as to like, as to like how I can help this situation, but, uh, Well,

william: could we, could we do something just as a task? It's not going to be polished.

alexander: Right. Cause I,

william: cause I want to get like, I want to make sure that like on my own time and when I, when I mess around with this stuff, that perplexity gets triggered. So can we test if I just call, use the same prompt, which is this, this is by, and then do I put something like here, like, uh, tools available? Like, would this work?

alexander: Yeah. And then I would say like, you have access to fire crawl and perplexity, uh, for your search. Yeah. You have access to the fire crawl. Let's just try that. Let's just try a super brief and see what happens. Cause to be honest, a lot of this is super, a lot of this is super experimental. Right. Like, yeah, there's really no foundations here. So you have access to follow your tools, fire crawl and perplexity. Yeah. That'll probably be best. Cool.

william: So like, like if like, like when we have new tools or whatever tools that apply to this prompt, I just have to add it like this potentially just add them as bullets.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah.

william: Okay. Uh, actually there's one thing here. I think I added this in the, in the chat. I'll, I'll, I'll, I eventually my, my goal here is to make these placeholders, like insert a copy cloud or, you know, client website, a client, client name and stuff. And then you have like a file where you just update it once and then it, it, it fills in the variables potentially. Is that, is that possible?

alexander: Uh, you have five dates once and it fills in the variable. Yeah. I see like a template problem pretty much.

william: Yeah. Like maybe like it's like, okay, here, here's your, here's your, your, your, your, your client. Here's the information website, you know, maybe Twitter. What's like a client name, et cetera. Right. And then all your prompts, if they have like, you know, client name and stuff, instead of actually going to the prompt and actually like filling in the blanks, which is not a big deal, but you just do it once in a file and it connects it together. You

alexander: get what

william: I'm

alexander: saying? Yeah. I get exactly what you're saying. Uh, yeah. So that's exactly what I'm trying to do. I really want to share this to you on a, on Wednesday because I mean, it's like not a tool or a platform or anything. It's literally just like a kind of structured file structure with like templates and stuff built into it. And I like a few cursor rules that I created around it to kind of have the whole thing work together, um, in, in a single like, you know, seamless way. So, so you, you can get rid of the law of, it's basically like, uh, a big template, like a template file, file folder, pretty much. But it's just more performant than all of this bullshit, like blue prints and stuff.

william: Yeah. Okay. Uh, all right. So if I go here and make a new session and I'm actually going to loop this right here, put this here. So I have actually one thing I didn't tell you, I made something cool. This is one thing awesome. They called a drag brand ignition kit. Uh, right. But more, sorry.

alexander: Well, more expressive. You just cut out. You cut out like the last 10 seconds.

william: Oh, sorry. I was going to say that like the, this, I made this document too, called brand ignition kit. And, and basically this is actually like, if I were to read this prompt. Yeah. Hold on. Let me. Yeah. If I go here, face two, blah, blah, blah, features before state. I have something here is that final deliverable. You will present your output into distinct parts. Actually, do I have, Oh, the strategic analysis brief. This actually contains the detailed findings from your phase one to phase two analysis, which is this. actually I made a mistake here. And then this is phase three. I actually, this, this actually represented my prompt. There was a mistake current. It was actually my prompt. That was a mistake. I should make this in, in three distinctive parts. That is brand provocation, which is brand ignition kit. Basically it's like I have, it's, it's basically like instructing it to do these set of like items. And then it's actually taking from a brand ignition kit, answering these questions as well, which I have separate questions. So it's just connecting it there. So now I've got perplexity here. I use, I use actually chat to be four zero for this. So

alexander: this is like a, kind of like a, like a swipe file a little bit, right? To an extent. Yeah. Okay.

william: It's like a swipe file, but more for like the actual questions.

alexander: Yeah. No, I like that. I like that. Like, yeah, that's great. Cool.

william: Yeah. So then, okay. So if you go in and do this, it's just press enter. Let's see what happens. But

alexander: like,

william: it sounds like you're like, it's missing this file. Right. But it shouldn't look for this file. Like, why is it even looking for this file?

alexander: Because it's, it's assuming. It's basically trying to find what you've already done. It's able to access your file system, regardless. Like that's one thing is that cursor has. So it will access a file and kind of expand on it. I don't know why it's doing that. Exactly. Can you just scroll down, please? I'm just going to go through the entire thing. Yeah. Also, to be honest, you, you are using GPT 4 .0. Which I think is a really shit model. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Try, try this with Claude. Try this with Claude. Okay. With Claude's sonnet.

UNKNOWN: Okay.

alexander: I personally hate GPT 4 .0. It also like just fucking throws emojis into everything. I don't know why.

william: Yeah, I know. I don't like that either. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's annoying.

alexander: So let's, um...

william: Should I make a new session? No,

alexander: no, no. You can scroll up. You can scroll up. And then press on that, on that, where your chat input. Where, like literally the question.

UNKNOWN: The...

alexander: Yeah, there we go. And then you can change the model on that one. Claude for sonnet. Yeah. There we go.

william: Do you, do you, do you... I usually do thinking. Yeah. I don't know if it's better than just the regular. I don't think it's more for like... Like what do you do for stuff like this? Is

alexander: it thinking it's better? I always just thinking. I mean, you get your limits faster, but like a little bit faster. But the performance... Yeah. Yeah, it's

william: better. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

alexander: And then I'll just send that in.

william: So then... Yeah, we're good? Yeah. Okay.

alexander: So this one's also checking what files are available. Because it's assuming the context within your file system. So it's probably gonna end up finding brown fundamentals. Yeah.

william: Yeah. But that's... Like, I don't want this because I'm trying to have it do it for the first time.

alexander: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like

william: this is... Yeah.

alexander: You're trying to build it.

william: I mean, this is... Yeah, this is basically going to be taking context that... Like,

alexander: you get what I'm saying, right? Yeah, you don't want it to access fire crawl.

william: But for this activity, we're just like, we're just going to see if it triggers perplexity, right?

alexander: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let it run the tool fire crawl. Let's just see if it comes with perplexity.

william: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Is there a way to like auto say like, yes?

alexander: That is so annoying. It's basically... I've checked so many times there isn't because they're terrified of you leaving your session and it runs like a thousand tools. Which at the beginning, they had it auto do it. And then people just got charged through their like fucking mind pretty much. There we go. Yeah. Yeah.

william: Oh, nice. Okay, cool. That's good. Calling for flexi ass. What's the difference between fire crawl underscore map and underscore... Well, scraping, I imagine just scraping. Well, what's map?

alexander: Map is going to look at the website and look at the entire website structure.

william: Like in what way? Like in an HTML way or like design way?

alexander: In a HTML way. So when you use fire crawl and you give like a blog post or whatever, it's only going to get access to the HTML to in that page. But if you do like fire crawl map, it's going to take the entire website and just see what the entire file structure is within the website. Um, and then like, it gives you kind of insight of what the website looks like. So it might list like the 20 other blog posts it has and finds the best one to do it and scrape that blog post if it makes sense.

william: Well, like, okay. So would this apply more? Cause there's not a website to just lazy load or just like, you know, load more type of thing where a bit like, you know, when you, when you, when you load the first part of the website, when you scroll and maybe you have to go press a button to load more or like learn more. Um, does it scrape only what's initially invisible on the screen and ignore the other stuff that you have to, let's say, click a button or scroll to trigger the new content.

alexander: Yeah. So that's kind of what the problem fire crawl solved, which is why everyone loves it. It's like, well, firstly, HTML, when you render it, everything is registered. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, there's situations where content is rendered with JavaScript as you, as I think what you're, what you're referencing. Like it literally like you press a button, it forms a fetch, it gets the data in. Right. Uh, it does have, it does have a method to handle that as well. Um, but most times like 85 % of the time, the content is already rendered. It's just like the UI stuff pretty much. It would be bad software engine to like fetch in more information. If, uh, if you're just trying to like, like read more thing, like that would be pretty insane because it should be super unusable. Um,

william: yeah.

UNKNOWN: Yeah.

william: Yeah. So, so, so like we have full confidence that fire crawl, when it does scrape the site, it's scraping everything or like, is that the idea?

alexander: Yeah. So, I mean, they actually, they have loads of different, like different, um, modes. Now they have an agent mode, which is very interesting, which is like, you just reference the site URL and you kind of give it like a prompt within its scrape. Um, and it will like go through the site and navigate the entire site by itself and like extract it into like a markdown research report based off that site. And it would basically be performing what we're performing now. Um, but with an agent layer on top of it, which it's like, it's an interesting, uh, approach to it. And I've, I've done it before and it does work to be honest with you. Like I did it, I used it for when I wanted to scrape like mass scrape websites to get all their socials. Right. What I was doing was like, I'd go in the homepage and just hope to God that there's like a footer of the socials in it and then scrape the HTML and then like, uh, put it through chat to you and say, Hey, if this, if the socials are in this website, like scrape it, right? Like extract it from this HTML. But I, uh, they allowed you to do this new agent mode, which is like, you just give it an objective. It's like, go through this entire website and find where the socials are and just extract them. It was like a 60 % improvement in terms of finding the right social stuff. So they have different modes. They have different modes. So it's pretty cool.

william: Could we have like, so MCPs are tools, right?

alexander: Yeah.

william: Like that's kind of what it is. Yeah. Can you have an MCP as an, an agent kind of what you're describing?

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, all it is, is like an input output, right? So like if the output takes like two minutes cause just trade another agent, that's fine. Like this is what exactly what's happening here with complexity. There's like two agents involved. There's one agent, which was our agent, cursed agent, which is instigating the research. Right. Yeah. But then we send the request. Yeah. You have to accept that. Okay. Send the request. And then like it's triggering another agent, which is the perplexing agent to perform the tasks at its disposal. So you have these like crazy, there's like an architecture that's coming out now, which is like three MCPs in a row, which is a bit wild, but it's interesting. So like one agent triggers. What do you

william: mean? What do you mean? What do you mean three MCPs? So

alexander: one agent triggers like another agent through an MCP tool call, but that agent has access to MCP tool calls. Oh. And it triggers like another one, which goes, like keeps it going down. Like all those specialize in their own purpose. So it's interesting. Like very limited. Like Russian,

william: like Russian dolls.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Like there's limited use cases for that, but it's like, if you're looking for super comprehensive stuff, it's, um, it's pretty interesting. Okay.

william: Uh, I have to review this, but this looks, this looks like it's more information too.

alexander: Yeah. That's, that would probably be from perplexity. Perplexity really gives you a shit ton of, of information too. Obviously.

william: Can you say reduction costs? Okay. This looks pretty good actually. Okay. This looks, looks beefier. Not just like, I'm just reading it just to make sure that, you know, just because it's more doesn't mean it's better, but it looks more detailed. Sure. Okay. I'll idealize brand. Mission and vision and your purpose. This is like, so this is one of the questions of like, you know, imagine your, or those, those, that brand ignition kit. Basically the brand ignition kit is, is just like, when you do a workshop for the brand fundamentals and you're doing this, like, you know, with actual stakeholders, you ask them these questions.

alexander: Gotcha.

william: Right. And, uh, these questions are like, it's, it's, it's kind of like the workshop questions, but they almost serve as like, I kind of like to see it as like, you know, those, like those elaborate personality tests, not like those shitty ones you see on Facebook, but like those business ones that they pay like 50 bucks a test for the employer to get a sense of who they are. Yeah. Right. It's, it's kind of like that, but for like the brand. Yeah. Right. And to get the outputs of that, you have to talk to like the exact stakeholders who have founders. And, and then from that information, you're able to gather what their mission is. So it's like, they're not necessarily, sometimes you actually can ask them, but sometimes you get better answers and better insights by asking them kind of like another question that will allude to what they really care about. Anyway. Sure. So that's, that's kind of what the brand mission. And I totally get

alexander: like what you reference about this library of like books, for example, which kind of like, that's where all these questions I see were coming from. Right. And also your experience for sure. But yeah, it's exactly.

william: So it's, it's like, it's, it's like just reading a lot of that, creating my own things, but a lot of it is inspired by like, not just one book, but maybe like five really good books. Right. Right. And compiling that stuff. I also just on that note too, I don't want to go into attention cause I could talk about for hours. Um, I, it would be awesome. This would be amazing to like develop. This is kind of the, kind of the optimization, the brain kind of phase that we were talking about to create, let's say like a really good or many, many different types of mentors. Right. Depending on what you want to do. Right. Like whether it's content, whether it's just purely on brand, whether it's purely on, like analysis or just say creative ideas and separate ways to like, to kind of act like train different, almost brains around it, you know, like create brains around that. Or maybe have a, I don't know, maybe have like one super brain. I'm

alexander: not sure. When you say brains, do you mean like personalities or, or like type like agents or whatever?

william: Yeah. Like, like what if, for example, let's like, you know, marketing is an umbrella term,

alexander: right?

william: Branding is an umbrella term, right? There's many different like disciplines, right? On, on, on marketing. So let's say it's one that sets a brand strategist around that. Right. If I were to get, let's say the top five books on brand strategy, right? Or branding in general. Right. Um, all these books are, they're not like, they don't contradict each other. They compliment each other. Right. One book has one approach to branding. Another one has another, but they, but they're not like different. Well, they are different, but they're just different approaches, but they kind of get the same kind of results,

alexander: right?

william: Sure. If I get, if I get five books that don't necessarily, necessarily overlap with each other, but compliment each other, have, let's say the LLM or whatever trained on it as its own brain. And then if I were to trigger, let's say I'm working on some sort of, let's say, uh, let's say it's, it's a situation I have, or maybe like, I just want to describe the situation and I need some kind of, let's say advice or what, what they think. Could be some, some, some ways to approach it. Or maybe it's just a content piece and say like, there's this a line with the, like, this is our brand strategy. This is a line based on this stuff. Right. If I get, let's say if these books, he's like these books serve as some really good insights and I like bring it on and say five, I'm using five as an example. Could be 10, 10, 10 of the best books. Could I lean on that trained model to give me insight that maybe I'm not seeing. Right. Um, and as one example.

alexander: So, so this model, which let's just call agent for the sake of simplicity. Right. Because it's what I, when I think of agent, I think of like a personality. Um, and what Claude code is allowing you to do is you're allowed to reference like tools at the moment. So you can actually limit the tools that certain personalities have access to. Like you might have a library of like 20 tools. Right. And you can say like, Hey, this personality, when I use like marketing researcher tool, like you could only use perplexity. You can only use fire crawl. Right. Which I think is a great one. So you're talking about like extending it. So it has like access to a certain kind of like knowledge base, which has very tailored type of information in there. Right.

william: Yeah. So there's, um, and, and if you really want to, um, I like, I think one of the, it's a popular book, but I don't think a lot of market, like it depends on who you talk to. There's, there's these books by a guy named Jack Trout and Alan Rice. Right. There's, there's a book specifically called the 22 immutable laws of marketing. And there's one called the 22 immutable laws of branding. There's a lot of those two books. They're so very good. They're very good. There's also one called positioning. I, I, these guys are incredible. I, I love their books. Um, and the thing is, these are books from like 20 years ago. Sure.

alexander: They're

william: not like new books. Right. And, but it goes to show they have updated versions just because the examples are like, like examples from let's say the nineties. There's so big brands, but you could tell the examples are dated, but the beauty about, let's say, like the way I approach marketing is focus on, on first principles. Right.

alexander: Like they

william: kind of foundation, right. Cause everything else is a nuance, even with all the technologies changing, as you know, it's, it's rapid. What, what doesn't change is, and you, you actually referenced it too, is human psychology. Right. Our brains are still very much outdated operating systems. Right. That, that, that, that function in a very certain way. Right. And marketing is like, um, fundamentally how people perceive, um, how people are persuaded, how people are sold, how people understand, you know, and communicate, et cetera. These books give you so much clarity and understanding of how brands, like how brands win, how brands win, how they position, which ones, what the laws are. Right. Which kind of opened my eyes in terms of like, generally like almost universal principles. Right. Sure. Things like, for example, like positioning mindshare. Right. I'd say like in every single set category, you've got like the first big brand that takes up most of the market share. And then you've got the second that is still not that, you know, it's, it's still kind of far off with the first. And then trying to be third and then fourth and fifth in that is like a very, very hard thing to do. Right. Right. Maybe create a sub niche or a sub category in that category. Don't compete with the big brands. Right. There's always like very, very, like when you read it, it's like, Oh man, this is like common sense, but it's not that common.

alexander: Right.

william: Sure. Anyways, I, I, I, I just, in terms

alexander: of marketing. What you're referencing is this thing where it's like, some expert has managed to articulate something that's very subconscious to you. And so it was like, Oh, this makes so much fucking sense. But like, you never articulated it and then becomes like personalized knowledge.

william: Yeah. Like for example, something, and I had dealt with this, like a couple of, like, like a couple of months ago, I had one client and they are trying to create a new category. They were actually category creators. This is a month three, a category creator with a very, very new novel technology called restaking. Right. Yeah. Um, and they now are at this, this point, and then they basically are creating this new category where it's like cloud, but it's called the verifiable cloud where everything could get verified on chain. And you could take on off chain data, get it verified, but they're, they're technology. I won't, I won't go to the nitty gritty because it's, it's like not important for this, but off chain information and putting it back on chain.

alexander: Right.

william: Anyways, I won't get into the nitty gritty, but the point I'm trying to make is that you want to create this cloud suite that does this. So developers can use verifiable, let's say cryptographic proofs to prove that everything's on chain, even the off chain stuff. Right. Now they've run into a few problems. One is that maybe, maybe like now people don't understand that technology or, or, or, or they don't care about it. Right. Because it doesn't really have like, whether something's verified on the cloud or not, do people really care about it? Right. Maybe, maybe in the future when you've got these AI agents now acting on behalf of like big companies and moving fucking billions of dollars. Yeah. You need the cryptographic proofs to verify everything's on chain. Or let's say if an AI goes rogue, you want to understand how it went rogue. Right. And it's all on chain to understand that stuff. Right. So I get the future use cases. The point I'm trying to make is that they focus on the product and you focus on marketing the product. And I was telling them, don't do it this way because it's, it's not a good approach focus. If you're creating a new category, promote the category, promote market the category, because if you're a first mover in a category, but you need to have people, your audience, your target demographic, understand the category first before they understand your product. Because if you go product first in a new category, they will understand two things, your product, cause it's, it's complex and also the category. Yeah.

alexander: Right.

william: If you create and market and create awareness and education around the new category, and you're the first mover in a new category. Well, guess what? If they understand the use case of the category, they only have one person to pick, which is the product. Right. So you kind of already did the work of your marketing your brand by actually first parking the category. Yeah. Anyways, I learned that from that book. Like I read this book like years ago. Right. Right. But I wouldn't have been able to, let's say, explain that and also see kind of like how they're having trouble now. Mm -hmm. About brand comprehension and their tech comprehension because they never put the work into, into actually promoting the category and creating education through the category. Right. But that's my point is that if I didn't read that, that, that part, it like, I wouldn't be able to understand it strategically in that point of view. And

alexander: also,

william: you can start to see, understanding these things, you can start to see predictable outcomes of things.

alexander: Yeah.

william: I'm not saying 100%, but, you know, like any sort of law, if you disobey the law, chances are you're going to get either, you know, a bad outcome.

alexander: Right. Or a good

william: outcome if you, if you adhere to it. Right.

alexander: And these are fundamental laws as well, right? Which, which. Fundamental

william: principles.

alexander: Yeah. Exactly.

william: Yeah. So if, if, if we can train this stuff with these books and other books as well, as not as more about like fundamentals. Mm -hmm.

alexander: So

william: that I can reference this, this may be a, as you put it, agent or this and that. And then if I have, it's okay, well, what would this agent say about this? Or what does agent say about this? Right. Sure. I'll have like this really good, I'm just, and that, and no, I have like, by readings, I read all the books I'm going to put this in. Right. But you know, I'm, I'm not going to remember every, everything in every book. You know, every principal, but these LLM school.

alexander: Yeah. And to be honest with you, it probably already has been trained on it. I would bet my money that, that they've already put all the books into it. So like, I actually wonder how far you'd get by just putting in a prompt or putting it in the person, the, the club, the personality. Say that you are, uh, like, like, like

william: Jack Trout, how it writes.

alexander: Yeah. Literally. Yeah. Exactly. Just say you are Jack Trout, how it writes, or like you have, uh, you are trained and like apply. Uh, you're trained and are well -versed in the fundamental laws and you don't break them. Like, just probably try that. Just see where that gets you already. It'd be very interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Or, or, or, I mean, if you want to go even a layer deeper in that reasoning step that I told you where it said it has to kind of like give the reasoning, you should probably, you could be like, you know, how does this align with the laws of, uh, the 22 laws? Something like that, right? Yeah. And just see, see where it's kind of referencing it. I think my, my point is like, I, I, I love the vision that you're building out in terms of the usage of certain knowledge. Right. And that's a hundred percent correct. But like, I also think there's like, if you could already start getting like 30, 40 % gains by trying this out and also just being experimental with it. I don't know if it's going to work. I don't know if it is trained on it. It's just worth trying. Yeah.

william: Well, no, it probably is. The, the, the question I have is that how, um, yeah, you're, you're right. It would give it, cause I, I tried in the past. It does give me like, and it gives me a decent answer, but if I were to get this train of specific books or so, will it give me a better answer than just the general knowledge of these, these books? That's the question.

alexander: Uh, probably, probably like, not probably like almost a hundred percent sure it would. If you were to, if you were to fine tune like Leah's model off of the book itself.

william: Yeah. Or like, let's say like for branding or positioning. Right. I got like five books. One of the books is old. Is that book? Right.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah.

william: Versus like saying, okay, Chad, like, like reference Jack, I'll raise on, I'm positioning about, you know, et cetera. Right. Like which one would be better and how much better? Sure. Sure.

alexander: Yeah. I mean, that's a, that's a very, I mean, I would love to try that out. Like we can get to that point. We can definitely try it out. And I think, yeah, start with like the personalities and the agents and just see how far that gets us. And, uh, again, once we get to a point where this is optimized, we have metrics and stuff. We can actually like any basis. And yeah. I'll outline this in your vision statement in terms of like the three stages, but it's almost like a stage 2 .5, which is like, if you could measure it, you can optimize it. Right. So we kind of have to get some measurable KPIs and let's get super event with it down the line. Um, and we can actually see like, Oh, when we fine tune it on the books of, uh, Jack tries, like, you know, we get a 25 % improvement or whatever it might be. Right. Um, and, uh, keep in mind, like we're playing in a game, which is very, very, very novel. Uh, I actually want to the shout out, like my personal branding strategy myself is like, I want to be the guy that marketers go to when they realize that cursor and like agent based, like workflows and all that kind of stuff in terms of marketing. And, and what we're trying to establish here is like going to be massively, like by far the best way to do marketing in the agent world. Right. And how you have full dominion control over of like, you don't, you're not like using some third party platform. You're basically writing code. Like you're kind of like turning like marketers and engineers by implementing them into cursor. And I want to be like the first guy who does that or like be that market maker. Right. You know, you know,

william: a hundred percent. Yeah. And actually that was actually one, I know kind of running on a tangent, like we kind of always do. Yeah. So it's just, just, just one thing on that note. And this is kind of goes back to the whole thing, talking about the content strategy, but like, how do we approach if we were to, let's say, come up with some series or some, maybe it has to be as formalized as a series. Maybe, maybe series is the wrong word, but in a way we're like, we have like a loose treatment or outline of, of like, okay, what do we actually build in public? What are we saying? We're in the phases so people can follow. Right. Uh, cause it'd be good to, like, I was thinking too, it's like, um, let's say like, like, like, like I have a sub stack and I wrote one article. Like that was last year. Nothing. You have a sub stack where I divide them in chapters of how do I approach, you know, this stuff. And you like, you, you, you have your article and stuff. What, what is, what, what are we talking about? Maybe like we have, uh, I don't know, a session a week or maybe a session a couple of times where, where we, we just, we, we talk. But we, it's like what our workflow is or like how we approach it. But there's a sense, I like the fact that we, we, we talk about actionable steps, but we also talk about, I don't know if you call it philosophy or the direction. Maybe it's more about the approach. Sure. Right. And, and, and, and what, why I'm bringing this all up now is that I was thinking about this over the weekend and I'm like, and especially doing this stuff. And, and, and now kind of like seeing, okay. I was kind of doing this prompting and all that stuff for a year before, uh, like since, since, since chat should be came out. But what's different here is that I'm starting to see now marketing and how this is as like, almost like a market. It's like a marketing architect, which

alexander: is

william: now like, like, like a job that no one, like, like I haven't heard that job, but I'm like, you've got like these AI engineers, like who are our AI architects. Right. Now it's like, I'm not now writing the articles like it did in the past. I'm not workshopping from scratch, legit working on the actual brand fundamentals or taglines or slogans and this and that. AI has become part of, of, of, of the workflow, right. The last one or two years talking to chat GPT or, or cloud, whatever. But now it's like the second of this, this new elevated approach of like, how do I build an actual system for a client? Right.

alexander: We're

william: not, I think this is the future.

alexander: Right. I think this

william: is like, it's going to be like legit in five, 10 years now, it's not going to be like, okay, are you a good writer? Which I obviously, I think you should still be a good writer and be good at, you know, and stuff, but it should be like the requirements of like, whether it's cursor or whatever, the flavor that they want to deploy that infrastructure. It's like, instead of saying, okay, you need to write content, build, build the machine to write the content.

alexander: Right. Yeah. Yeah. And this is actually like an interesting one for me was one of the clients I landed. He looked at my website and he was like, I was like, Oh, why, why did you book a call with me? And he was like, you called yourself a content systems engineer. And I was like, yeah, he was like, what the fuck is that? I've never heard that in my life. And I was like, Oh, it's an engineer who specializes entirely like in creating content systems. He's like, what the fuck's a content system? I'm like, well, it's a unified system that incorporates like third party workflows. It incorporates like AI tools, incorporates marketing specialists and kind of like the context behind it just to create marketing outputs. And he was like, Oh, it's like an interesting job. I never heard that thing because it's not, it's a novel thing. And you're going to have to cut trying to invent that space. And I think you're hitting the nail on the head when you say like, there's a role because it's part of that. Like kind of a new stack, which is like the content orchestrator, right? Or like the marketing orchestrator who kind of sees how the system comes together, almost like plays a little bit, like has the marketing knowledge to know if the system is operating effectively, which is why I was so keen to work with you. Cause I totally saw within the first call, like, Oh shit, this is the guy. Like, he's not just a client. He's like someone who's truly gets it and like, see where the power of it going. And just, I'm not going to take you too much time, but just to bounce off what you're saying here. I'm like this framework that I'm building now, I'm getting super ambitious with it now because I'm like, okay, the cool, it's cool. We have a file system, but then I, I, over the weekend, I spent like a solid three hours, like looking into creating a programming language, which is like entirely for just marketing workflows. So it's like, not like complex code. It's all English, but it operates like a programming language. And I'll just like, Oh, that could be fucking interesting. I'm not going to build it now, but it's like the whole thesis is like, Hey, okay. Content people are going to become more like engineers a little bit. It's like, what tooling do they need at the disposal? I was like, just.

william: So, so, you know, it's funny because, okay, there's two things here. One is, um, one very quick thing. Sam Altman said that like, you know, you know, like AI will take, yeah. It will limit a lot of jobs, but you'll also create a lot of new jobs. Right. And so, and a lot of those jobs, we don't know what those are going to be. Right. Things like, you know, what we call it marketing architecture, content architect, content engineer, whatever. Right. I think those are going to be those new jobs that we're referring to. Sure. Right.

alexander: That's going to

william: place this. On, on the other point about this, this language over the weekend. And also it was last week. So VO3, people have been getting, um, pretty good. So people have been like sharing some really good prompts and they're in Jason format.

alexander: Yeah. Have you seen those? Yeah. Yeah.

william: Yeah.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Is that, is that similar to what you're thinking in terms of the language?

alexander: Yeah. I mean, what I was thinking here, right. Like, you know how you have like a markdown file that says like brand ignition kit. Like we have this concept in programming called like imports. It's like, basically like if you want to reference code that you wrote in another file, your file, I was like already so simply just fucking like importing this, like one file to another and just referencing like, Hey, use this file as like, uh, as a, how you say, um, a reference. I actually wasn't even going to be a programming language. Like it was just going to be like an extension of markdown. So you can enable imports from one markdown to another. So you just write a prompt, uh, that kind of like enables you to do that. But there's also kind of like another aspect of like some parts of the workflows you're defining is going to need to trigger third party tools and almost having the programmatic access. So you kind of need to define that as well. Um, so I was just thinking about all that, but it's like, it's just like in the back of my head, pretty much. I'm not really doing anything on the back of it.

william: So like the question I have is that if, if, if we were to get that markdown, right. And it's like these kinds of chains of like references, references, right. And we got the prompts, we got like fine tune these prompts, right. We fine tune everything. Right. Um, do you, do you see a world where, and I, I, maybe this is not now, obviously not now, but maybe in a very, in a foreseeable future where human in the loop, and I'm not saying I'm, I'm all for human in the loop, right. As you know, but could we fine tune it where human in the loop is more about human in the loop is looking at the actual architecture and not actually talking to chats as a system. Yeah.

alexander: Right. For

william: example, like, it's like the output for content generation. It's like, Oh, like, well, I like it this way. It's like, well, what part of my architecture can I optimize so that I'm not, I don't even have to actually talk to the chat.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what I was, I'm super excited to show it to you on Wednesday. I really want to get done. It was a lot more complexity involved than I thought there was going to be. So when I started designing like a week and a half ago, I was like, Oh, just a fucking file system with some cursor rules. And I was like, okay, no, there's like, I had to correct a graph dependency chain that refreshes itself. So like, if you change like brand fundamentals, it's going to push you to change like content strategy and Twitter strategy, all that kind of stuff, because it's all interlinked with each other. Right. Anyway, all things aside, frameworks that really do really quite well are called their opinionated frameworks. So if you look into web programming back in the day, like if you thought about how like Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, he wrote all of it like in raw code. So, and people have different ways of how they approach code. It's basically a working process, right? They just think about something in a different type of way. And the beauty of like software architecture and engineering is that some people like are so experienced or just so good at writing good code. They're kind of thinking of like how information like flows through and like what that information needs or like for the system to kind of act on it or like what the system needs at different points within this, within like the entire software architecture. And like that makes a great software architect. Right. And there's like a difference between a software engineer and a software architect. And we kind of have the same pattern that's happening here where like software engineers who actually write code, like a copywriter would write a tweet, are becoming like more and more like irrelevant. But software architects are like becoming more and more empowered because they have like this grand vision of like what should the system, like what should it achieve? Like what are the, like the output they want to get from it? What does good look like? That, like, these are the questions that you're kind of focusing now on more, like more design. And then it's like kind of like raw fundamentals. So I was like, okay, what would like an opinionated? And then, and then when I was mentioning like, what happens is like, there are really good engineers who identify enough patterns, they turn into a framework. So it's like a set of rules and they kind of like give you some constraints, a little bit like guardrails that enable you to operate within it. So you, you don't just like completely go out and just do something that's completely fucking stupid. Right. And so like one example is like with next JS is like, they create this beautiful website framework that like had all the best fundamentals implied within it. And so it was like super easy to use. And so I was like, okay, like what would that equivalent be for this? Like what are good guardrails that you can kind of set? And so the stuff, the thing I'm going to show you on Wednesday, I've limited the input to like three things. You can create agent personas. You can create the template, which is the output that you want. And you can create the workflow, the thinking process to get to that point. That's all you can do. And so I'm like kind of like limiting you a little bit, but it's to force you to think more about like what the workflow looks like and what good looks like, as opposed to like actually writing any of it yourself. Right. And I'm just, I'm just testing it. I don't know if it's going to work. If you're going to like it, if I'm going to like it, I don't know. But I, it's just kind of like, that's kind of what I'm trying to achieve here. Essentially. If that makes sense. So you've

william: got, yeah. So you've got, um, so basically the, like these guardrails are more, or it's more of a, you approach, right. Is like you said, it was outputs, which is more like, is that the prompt?

alexander: Uh, so that would be the template, the template that you define in your notion. You define templates, like what a good template would look like. Yeah.

william: Okay. Okay. So examples.

alexander: Yeah. Examples.

william: Yeah. But, but that is, is that, but that's not the problem.

alexander: No, no. Then the workflow itself would be the prompt. So when I say workflow, I'm differentiating between like a third party workflow. You just trigger like the web scraper or Twitter scraper. Okay. And a workflow here is like kind of, you know how you did that prompt and you have three phases? Yeah. Like that would be a workflow. Cause there's three phases. Right. So there's kind of like a step -by -step process you go through. You could break it down to sub, subtasks, all that kind of stuff. Like that is like the gold standard, I think of really good, uh, prompting is when you break it. So,

william: so, so right now, what, what we're working on right now is, is aligned with what you're working on in terms of like this way.

alexander: A hundred percent, a hundred percent aligned. And, and it's like, what I'm trying to do is like, I'm trying to like, make sure that's valuable to you. Right. Like I don't want to force anyone down a way that is like, not actually the most optimal. So I'm just like, curious to see like, what is the best kind of situation here, but I can already see like, by just watching you here and you're kind of working with it and you're thinking about it. And I'm not really, I'm not telling you what to do like explicitly. And I'm giving, I'm giving you feedback where I can, like, I can already see a limitation. I mean, look, look at like that left side field right there. Like, like bragging edition kit is like a resource that you're using to create brand fundamentals. And then if you create a content strategy off brand fundamentals, like the problem is immediate, where if you change brand fundamentals, your, your content strategy is like stale. It no longer is like a real reflection of brand fundamentals. There's a dependency there. So that's another thing. Your file system is going to get fucked up when you start creating content. You're going to have like a shit ton of content files coming out. So like you kind of needed the pay and aid framework to build around that. Um, and so that's kind of what I'm building already. And I'm like, you're kind of like, we're going to be the user. Number one, well, actually, no, I'm the user. So I really need it like desperately. Cause I want to be creating a shit ton more content. Um, so I'm just trying to see what kind of works here pretty much.

william: Yeah. Which is, which is really good. This is, uh, yeah, that's yeah. I'm excited to, to see it. There's, there's a few things. Cause that I'm sure that we can happen in 10 minutes.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Um, and this right here, I'll, I'll review this. This looks better. I just find skimming it. I'll, uh, maybe action steps here is I'll, I'll review this. Cause even like, like this is actually very good. A small change. Right. With adding perplexity, for example, and, and adding that little, like use these tools and stuff. Made, made this just by looking at it a lot beefier. Right. Yeah. I'm going to go like cross -check this with my, what, what my, what I thought the best output was. Let's say like, you know, when I was doing this three days ago and see, okay. Which it looks like it is already better, but yeah. Then I want to add the references. Like the reason about citations and, and, uh, and sources and like that deduction reasoning for each section. Um, and then I'll, I'll play around with that. The other, there's two things here. Um, go back. Okay. So should we, I know we didn't have a lot of time to do the competitive analysis, but I think this is very important. I think just brand fundamentals, it's like how I, how I approach marketing. And it's funny. Cause I don't think I'm not saying a lot. I think good marketers do it. A lot of, a lot of marketers take shortcuts and they don't do this stuff. Okay.

alexander: Right.

william: And they, and, and, and the reason why I'm saying this is that this stuff is like, I think it's going to get a lot more interesting. Not much interesting. Um, like brand fundamental stuff, like it's, it's needed, but like, you know, that's one part of it. When we like content regeneration is when we start to really, you know, think about like, holy shit, like this is a stuff, right? Exciting stuff. Brand fundamentals is like the first part to kind of be stepping stones. It has to be really good. And then you've got competitor analysis. I think I'll, I'll play around with this. I think we're going to get to a good stage. Comp analysis. That's going to be a good one because I think that's when you really start to set, um, a really, you start to really get really good strategic insights on how to generate the content. Sure. Brand fundamentals is more on like, how do you actually express that content? Yeah. Like your brand content. Comparer analysis is a very, it's not the only, but it's a very good way on actually what to do. Right. You

alexander: know,

william: what, what, what to actually talk about. Yeah.

alexander: Right.

william: Um, and it's not just for comp analysis, but that's one good component to it. So the second part of comp analysis, we have to like, I guess their next session is let's like, this is what I'm thinking. And tell me if there's anything I should cut out or I should add to it is let's say for example, like this is how I'm seeing it as like an architect. Right. Like I'd approach it and you tell me if there's a better way or, or whatever. There's, we got a competitor, one session per competitor. You, you overload the context, but our session would be multiple. It's, it's just not going to grasp, get everything. Right. So let's say, let's say we have four competitors, four key competitors, one session, one competitor, scrapes, website, scrapes, any, maybe anything on, on, on, on. Again, maybe actually perplexing would be good because perplexing crawls are web. Right. So we got sentiment maybe, or like, let's say PR or whatever. Right. Sentiment may be different for socials. So you got web, we got scraped website. We've got perplexity for web. That's one thing. It will understand the competitor to a decent part. The one thing that's missing. Um, and this is more for, for my, I guess, for Web3 and stuff. Yeah. There's a lot of social, like social channels. Twitter is the best. You know, Twitter. LinkedIn, maybe for some stuff for this specific one too, but you know, Twitter, Twitter is like the best. To scrape Twitter, call it one, one year's worth of posts. Kind of like what you were doing too, with the media. I think that's good. The way that, that, cause you, you still can draw a lot of information from, especially with a lot of people with video heavy stuff. You're able to transcribe the video and actually have the LM understand the videos. Right. That's, that's amazing. That's incredible. I didn't even think that was even possible. So that's, that's amazing. Um, have that as one part. So you got one competitor website perplexity, like search in general, and you got their socials and then find a way. And with the prompts and I, I, I have ideas on how to approach it, create a report. Right. But the report's going to be pretty. Yeah. Like it's going to be pretty, pretty blank. I don't want to make it too long, but it's going to be heavy. Right. Then you've got one report. Walrus is one, three, you got to do it for the other three. You got three really good, robust reports, 360 of that. Right. Maybe. And the thing is, is that, and this is a question later on, do we, do we apply, like you have like your EBS score. Do we apply the scoring of that in the report? Or is that, does it come later? We don't have to answer that question right now, but the idea here is that the workflow is comp analysis. Given those, those three variables, search, scraping website, social, Twitter for, for competitors. Then, like you said, you create a bigger report, a comparative analysis, right? It's basically like this. I'm talking about competitor research and the comp analysis is actually taking four competitor research reports and then doing the competitor analysis into the fifth report, which is the comp analysis. Then, then you have the comp analysis. We can draw insights. Like my comp analysis, even the research is not just about like, what's their, what are they're about, blah, blah, blah, who are their customers, but more about understanding and finding potential gaps. Right. Like we call it vulnerabilities or weaknesses and how Akave can win or Akave can, you know, let's say, you know, address those weaknesses for each one. Right. That, that then starts to provide a really good way with the comp analysis. It can provide what are maybe like, you know, the guiding, whether it's Nord store or like the guide in which, how we should approach the brand, how should you approach content? Sure. Right. Right. For example, in raw risk, one, one thing that came up with one of the reports I was doing for comp analysis that I was messing around was that it's very jargon heavy, very Web3 heavy. Right. Which is like, you know, yeah. Like if a Web3, you know, customer wants to read it, that's great. But maybe one, one, like one insight is like Akave can be, you know, still communicate the product offering, but lay off like the jargon and Web3 heavy language. Right. That's just one example. So that, that could be a guide. And I think Akave, well, they are doing that and we like, we are doing that to some level, but maybe there's better ways to do that. Right. Which is an insight of how to generate the content.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Right.

william: So that, at least that is an example. But the point I'm trying to make is that that's kind of how I'm seeing it in terms of the comp analysis. And I know this is kind of taking over, like where we're spending a lot of time on, on these things, but I generally think it's necessary to get this done.

alexander: I

william: agree

alexander: with you. I agree with you. You want to build the foundations, right? Everything else depends on this. So I agree with you.

william: Yeah.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Yeah. So the next one, I'll, I'll play around with this fundamental stuff. I'll have any, if I have any questions, I'll ask you and everything. Cool. And then the next session, we go comp analysis. Uh, let me know if I need any tools or download because I know there's the Twitter scraper or is it as easy as adding an MCP or do I need an API or API key for anything for

alexander: Twitter? Well, no, what I want to do is I'm going to build it out, um, to scrape profiles and I'll just have that workflow done by Wednesday. And I'll just give you my MCP access for, uh, to play around with. And then, and if you like it, we can just import it into your own, uh, and then it says, and I'll just set up for you. Just, just for the sake of, of development speed, to be honest with you.

william: Okay.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Okay. And then, uh, okay. So our next meeting, uh, is it, I can do it tomorrow, but if you need, cause you said you want to show some stuff on Wednesday, is Wednesday better for, for this?

alexander: Yeah. I was thinking like Monday, Wednesday, Friday is a good cadence for me to be honest with you. It's like three sessions a week. It gives us like blocks of time between it to kind of iterate on improve on it. Um, but I don't know what you think about that.

william: Just, I'm good with it. Just, I know, I know the last few Wednesdays have been. Um, that last few Fridays haven't been available this Friday. I'm actually moving. I'm going to Brazil for a bit.

alexander: Okay. So

william: I'm leaving on Friday, Friday morning, so I won't be available. I'll be offline Friday. Um, but we

alexander: can do one day.

william: Well, we did Monday today, Wednesday, I don't know, Thursday, potentially.

alexander: Yeah. Cool. That's awesome.

william: Okay. Wednesday, Thursday. So comp analysis on Wednesday. Uh, is there any things, action items on my end? Like I'll, I'll play around with the, the comp analysis. Actually, I think perplexity now adding the complexity thing. I think that's going to be a good, good, uh, a good part that I can mess around with.

alexander: Yeah. Anything else

william: I need?

alexander: Well, I think stick with Claude, I think implement the, the, the kind of, um, re like feedback I gave you on the prompts, um, and see how that kind of gets you there. And then like, try and do that kind of like not framework that meant that I gave you, which was like, get to a good place after a few, like you're back and forth and just save the example. I think you should do that. And then we can kind of like, and think how the example was good and like, look at your just like responses and just infer from that what the prompt should be. If that makes sense. So, okay. Okay. Yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. Shift away from like the prompt first mentality, I think is, is going to, is going to do you a little bit good. Um, okay, cool. And then off the, off the back of the content thing, how did you want to move forward with that? Like practically speaking?

william: Yeah. Yeah. Good question. Um, I got to do this. I, okay. So basically like, Oh, like, like your personal brand from my understanding, high level, I'm sure there's more to it is that you want to be, um, like the, the person for AI content engineering or AI marketing, content engineering. Like that's, that's kind of the,

alexander: I'm making a bet that engineer, uh, marketers are going to be incentivized to move more towards engineering. Like engineering art, like architect ask. For sure.

william: I, I, I think your bet's a good one to be honest. So like, I, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, so, so why I'm saying that is that that, that that's your kind of category and your broadly, like there's no specific, I mean, that's already a niche in itself and a very, like, it's a very new thing. Right. But in terms of marketing, uh, clients that you want to get.

alexander: Right.

william: Yeah. Did you say they're agencies or they can also be brands as well?

alexander: Yeah. So it was weird. I got, I gained a lot of interest in brands who are like, ascend is one of them. Right. And then I was like a two other ones who reached out to me over the weekend who were like, Hey, we'd love to have you on our team, be like our marketing guy. And I'm like, I don't think I'm marketing myself properly. If people think that I want to be like the chief marketer on a company, like I, I, what I, what I'm having to tell people a lot is like, no, I'm not that guy. I'm the guy who builds the system behind it. I work with a marketer. So like I make the marketer's life easier. I help him kind of become that like operator slash architect that I'm talking about, but also help him create the tooling that he needs, uh, to kind of build it out pretty much for him. Right. Um, so I'm really trying to position myself as that. So like I, where I see the kind of like gaping hole, if you're trying to fit into that place, or if you have another idea is like that guy, like the, the, the marketer architect that you're referencing pretty much. Um, yeah. Yeah. Well,

william: yeah. And that's kind of like where, that's why I asked, is that like, where, what are like, what is like, what, what do you want to do? And how do you want to be perceived? Right.

alexander: So,

william: sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. No, go on. What were you going to say?

alexander: I, I like, uh, I reason by analogy a lot. Um, just simplifies my life a shit ton. Uh, so I think of like the industrial revolution and like, and like what happened in manufacturing. So you have like a process that was happening in one way and then someone to create the factory and then someone to create like the, like the people who like learn how to operate the factories. So like, I kind of wanted to position myself as like the factory builder and then like, okay. And then like work with factory operators pretty much who like there's huge money if you made on both sides. I think there's the people who know to operate really good factories. That would be like Toyota. And like, but then the factory builder itself is just like, I don't know, like a manufacturer of tooling factories. Who fucking knows? Yeah.

william: Yeah. Which is a good analogy. I totally see that. Um, on, on my end, I would say like, I'm, I'm still very much in the web three niche. I like, I like web three. There's a lot of things I like about it, but there's a lot of things I like about it. Um, but for all like, it's also a niche that it's not, it's, I'm not saying it's hard to get into it. It's, it's, it's, it's still like, there's a lot of things. It's very alert. Right. And there's things that like, there's like playbooks, um, are, are, are constantly being written and it's so, it's so very new and nascent that there, you, you have to kind of like, you kind of have to be good at it. And I don't think anyone's really good at working marketing to be honest. Right. Like, including myself, by the way, like, I think, I think I'm like, we're like the non -citizen, I think we're kind of like, maybe better than most, but that's because we try to focus on more like those barking fundamentals and those principles still keeping into account just what three nuanced things and, and creativity, which is very, it's, it's something much more needed in this space. Right. Which, which I, which I, this is why I'm so excited with AI content generation around that. Um, that, that being said, um, I think it's a lot of, you know, um, I, I want to position myself. I, it was always AI, not AI, uh, what do you market in this and that? Right. I want to come as, as more of like, like the creative part of, we were doing more creative stuff last year. A lot of stuff, like the last of a non -citizen was Crystal and I just going, sitting down, just like the, the, the playing fields, even now we don't have to be this, you know, we don't have to have like, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars on production sets and this and that. We can make these really

alexander: cool

william: creative campaigns, story -based campaigns on, on, on our computer. Right. That was very exciting. Right. And this, we do, we, we, we did that. Now we have AI video, which we're, we're experimenting now and just messing around with that. Um, I still want to have that as a focus, as a creative, but on the web three part, but now with this whole AI architect type of thing, how do like, I approach marketing and more of like, and a systematic architect to do it. Cause I, I, I think this is like, I generally think this is not, I don't like, you see, you call it a bet. I think it's inevitable.

alexander: Yeah. That's good. That's good. Yeah.

william: No, it's, it's, it's, it's definitely headed towards that direction. Um, I, I think he like, like it's, it's going to be about how, yeah. Are you a good marketer to be again, that by marketer, are you going to be the Rick Rubin of how, how

alexander: good of a

william: Rick Rubin are you in marketing, but how good are you to actually maybe implement the system? I think it's going to be some people who are just going to be the Rick Rubins and there's going to be a variation of how good of a Rick Rubin you are. And there's going to be people, like you said, who can like, you know, architect this and think about it in more of an architect point of view.

alexander: Right.

william: Yeah. Some people will be able to do both. Some people are just going to be like, I want to be the architect. I want to be the Rick Rubin.

alexander: Right. Absolutely.

william: Um, and, and kind of like, again, exploring that sort of new way of thinking about marketing more so in the web three niche. It doesn't have to be, I don't, it's not like I'm like, you know, I actually don't like what, like talking about web three. I find it very boring because it's a lot of bullshit. Crystal's good. Like if you look at Crystal's content, she's really good. I think I tell you, she's getting reactions half the time. I don't even think that she just does it to get a reaction. I think some,

alexander: I think

william: she actually believes it, but some it's like, yeah, no, she's just, she's just fucking like, you know, she's poking the bear and people like real fucking, you know, like, but she's good. She's good. She's very good at that stuff. I honestly don't care. I can't do it. I honestly, I get so bored of people talking about the same bullshit. And, and, and it's like, I know I have to do it. It's why I haven't been fucking tweeting. But why I'm saying this is that I think this topic, it's just interesting.

alexander: Well, clearly you and I could sit on a call for two hours and just talk about the theory of it. Like we're obviously very passionate about it. Right. And, and boring marker is like probably the closest guy who's filling the gap for it. But he's still, he is like still playing really heavily to the whole marketing aspect, which I don't personally like that much. It's all about like super automated workflow libraries. Like he's even created a website that just shares like those like third party workflow libraries that are fully automated, no queue in the loop. I don't like that personally like that. Right. So I think from, from that perspective, someone who comes at it from the fundamentals and the theory is super interesting. And I think there's a huge gap in that aspect. I don't have that background for it. Right. Right. I do know. I'm one of the first people for sure. Like the first movers in terms of the engineering content side. And like, I refused and I have refused clients before I refuse to get away from that niche. Like I, I want to be in a super niche space. Like I might even have to go more niche than what I am now. And that's okay. Like I would rather be too niche than not niche enough. If that makes sense.

william: Um, yeah.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. So I,

william: I, I, I, I think I, I know, I understand the niche and the way it is, I'll even call it more like a, you're, you're in a new cat. You're like, this is a new category.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Right.

william: And it's like, you're, you're, you're, you're in like, you're, yeah. I mean, even the stuff about category creation by creating the education by informing. Right. It's like, by finding a new category, your job and your responsibility is to promote the category.

alexander: Yeah. Right. That's kind of what I was trying to like, that's why I was, I didn't communicate. Well, that's what I was trying to allude to in terms of like, since what we're doing now is we're literally pulling a cat. Like we're kind of like innovating in something and we're collaborating between engineer and marketer. Right. Who both like super passionate about their own skillset and trying to find an overlap to collaborate as something completely new. And I was like, you know, I do recognize the need to learn, to educate the audience. And for me, like my message is going to be the same one, which is like, if you're a marketer, you need to move towards more of a systematic, like, or operate a role. Like that's the one that I'm going to say. And the way that you referenced it was like the same message 50 times over. I'm trying to figure out the best way to say that, but I also recognize there's going to be a huge need for the education to do it. So yeah. Like, that's what I was kind of trying to tackle now. Cause I feel pretty validated in the approach. Um, an interest, as I mentioned, an interesting insight is businesses were more interested to work with me than any agencies, which I, my bet was that agencies were going to be because they're the ones who are like, really have. I, I,

william: I, uh, I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why that, that is. Um, the reason why is this is, this is the reason, um, agencies will, and even for us, I mean, for, for an example, we're kind of like sharing insights and stuff is that agencies, agencies will want to do it themselves. Yeah. Right. Or, or, or they're, or they're probably trying to like create the infrastructure, which technically that's what I'm doing with non -citizens.

alexander: Right.

william: Yeah. Whereas businesses, I, I think, yeah, with businesses, you're, um, they, they, they don't want to go to an agency and they think, oh, can I internalize this and, and, and empower. Sure. You're not necessarily, you're not replacing the marketing department. You're actually empowering them. Sure.

alexander: Right.

william: And I'm giving them this new kind of blueprint of how to approach marketing.

alexander: Right.

william: Um, so in a way you're kind of more like, it's funny. And in, in some ways, maybe not as little as maybe extreme, you're, you're in a way you, you, um, trying to, in your pursuit of trying to focus on having agencies as customers, I think you're going to be more of an agency killer. Well, I mean, that's not the goal.

alexander: Not,

william: not, not in like, you know, like, I, I, I don't mean that. Like, I think it'll be for agencies and stuff, but you got what I'm saying. It's like,

alexander: you, like,

william: if, if, if you provide a solution to a brand where they can generate all their content, but like very good content, not just some bullshit AI stock, but like in a very, you know, systematic way that understands the brand fundamentals and blah, blah, blah, and does it in a very, you know, uh, predictable, uh, high quality way. Like that's that's like, yeah. Like agencies, because design and stuff that brands will use them for, for certain purposes, but they're not like, if they have that already at home, they're not going to go search it up for an, an agency. Right.

alexander: That's a good point. That's my, my incentive with the agency though, is like, I, you have like X amount of clients. Right. And for me, like a good job is if you're able to perform a high quality of service across all clients. So I basically scaled you out essentially. Right. As opposed to, and I'm not like, my objective is not to replace. It's to scale scale, like scale marketing genius versus scale, like replacing with AI shit, which is where I think like all the platforms offer today, which is why I'm so set on agencies because they're the ones who are like, who just have seen everything and see all the different patterns and stuff. And like, for me, like if an agency is like, Hey, I was barely managing five clients because like, you know, we were spending so much time on copywriting and now they're like managing it with ease and performing better and like giving better insights to the business. Right. That's for me is a definition of a good job. Like I've created something worth creating. And by the way, the approach I'm going to take for this framework is a completely open source approach. Um, there's no platform. There's nothing. It's an open source approach. And if you want me to talk to you on the business model, I can down the line. If you want to, or now I don't really give a fuck. It's up to you. I'm super open about how I'm approaching it. And my whole marketing strategy is going to be like a really aggressive build in the open strategy. I'm super transparent. I want to be the first mover. I want to be clear that I'm the first mover. If there's a better engineer who builds it than me, fuck it, whatever. At least it's made. And I've contributed to something. So there we go.

william: But there's no, it's good. It's a very good attitude and say it is. Um, but like, for example, let me say it's super open and transparent. Like, are you going to have any gated content at all?

alexander: Gated content, I

william: mean like gated content, which is basically, you know, trade, trade the email address, or maybe trade. Again, I'm not saying that like trade a community subscription, like pay 20, 30 bucks, 100 bucks. I'm not, I'm not saying that, but I'm saying, as lead magnets, for example, for, for your own stuff, like for example, you give all this free content, but there's some really high values, which to be honest, I think everything I can be putting out is high value, especially when this is all very new and toggle. Um, but let's say you got some really extremely high value stuff to get the content where it's like you have to, let's say, give them, you know, your email address and then now you can nurture them for let's say a discovery call or whatever.

alexander: Oh, I have, I have a sub stack. I have a newsletter that I was thinking about developing. That's like, that would be the way that I'm, that is the way that I'm capturing emails. Uh, people are reaching out to me on Twitter primarily. I might have, I have like 40 followers on Twitter. I've done like, I've just been trying for last week and I want to get like much more systematic in it. Um, but I'm not looking to monetize the content because my objective is to educate, not to, not to monetize, like make money off of it. Um,

william: but sorry, sorry. Wait, when you say monetize the content, are we talking like monetize as in not get leads?

alexander: No, no, I definitely want leads, but there's a business model that I'm trying to replicate here. That did incredibly well. And that's called it's Vercel. Are you familiar with Vercel?

william: Yeah. I, yeah.

alexander: Yeah. So I,

william: I, I don't know the business model.

alexander: Well, it's open source. You make everything super transparent, clear. So you incentivize the community to work with you by making it open source. Engineers literally collaborate and like build out your platform for you pretty much or build out the system for you, especially if it's like this nerdy. I, I know for a fact, something this fucking dirty where it's like marketing, like, and you have like almost like have your own coding language or your own like framework and I'm aligning it with something called next JS. People would like love that. If you're an engineer, right. You'd love to get involved in that. It's just an interesting project. Um, so like you make it open source to incentivize like collaboration, you build a community around that. Right. Um, and for me, like the least guardrails to get to that point possible is better. But the way you monetize the thing is what Vercel did, which is you make it super easy to deploy a system. So you have all that in code. So you own the code. They own the code. Sorry. Like it's fully democratized. They can figure out a way to host themselves to pay a hundred. So they don't pay anything to me. I don't give a shit. That's completely fine. But you make it like super easy for them to deploy a fully integrated system. Like just by saying like, you know, whatever, just writing deploy into the terminal. And now they have a whole system that's hosted on the cloud pretty much that they can fetch like the context that they're looking for, for any activity they do across any workflow they work on down the line is, is really the way that I'm thinking about this as a product.

william: Oh, but like what's the business model though? Like how

alexander: do you

william: monetize

alexander: it? Well, you pay, they, they put, they pay for the cloud service. Essentially. Is that you, you make it easy for them to deploy a fully integrated solution. Uh, and they pay you for it pretty much as the, you have a cloud provider.

william: Oh, I see what you're saying. But then don't, don't they need fine tuning for their own business?

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Sure. And like, and they would, if you own the, if you help them build a framework where all the like marketing context strategy is within, right. And then you start getting to a place where you have to deploy a third, like a database, which we're going to do together, deploy a vector database, uh, do together like a knowledge base, then, and you make it super easy for you to deploy all of that. And it's all integrated in the code that you've helped develop. Then you've kind of created this like integrated ecosystem and you make money off of a, uh, either usage based, which I would definitely be much more aligned with over a subscription base. So it's being hosted somewhere. Like you're going to see, as we work through this, the, how powerful it is to add a database. You're going to see how powerful it is at a vector database and to fine tune the models and the power of you owning all the code yourself. So you can do it wherever you want. And like, it's all logic is there, but you'll still see this in the engineer who's needed to understand like the, the complexity of deploying all this stuff and making it work and integrating all these systems together, just deploy. And then what I do is like, okay, I'll just automate all that. And then just have you deploy it and pay like 20 bucks. When I not say have you, but I'd be like, that would be the business model down the line or whatever, or just usage based.

william: Okay.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Do you think you'll make a lot of money in doing that?

alexander: I, I, I honestly, I think when you're in a completely blue ocean strategy thing, um, where there's like, uh, you're kind of building out like the future, like dev ops or AI ops or whatever for a completely niche field, you have like a billion dollar company in my head. I know it's like diluted to say that, but like, that's kind of how I, I wouldn't be spending all my time and like having quit my job to go full in on this. Like I, I worked at the startup. I worked on content. I saw the pain point. I went all in on it. And I was just like, I just, I, I have it. I'm just making a bet. I can not, you know, I don't know for sure. But if you look at verse sales, like dynamics or AWS is dynamics, you know, the bottom line of it.

william: So, so you said that they, like you build this architecture ecosystem for content generation. You hosted on the, you put on for sale. People can deploy it off for sale.

alexander: No, I wouldn't. I basically want to create the verse sale for. For deploying these systems. Like that's the business. Oh.

william: Oh, sorry, sir. I thought this was going to be on verse. Oh, you're saying you're going to create like a marketing verse sell and then. Oh, interesting.

alexander: Okay. Verse sell is the web development verse sell, right? Yeah. Yeah. Any website you deploy, you do it through there. I want to do the same thing for marketing.

william: Interesting. Interesting. So

alexander: you basically have a fully hosted content intelligence system. Right. So like, let's say you create like, um, you go through this process where we're defining these workflows. We're defining like how your content strategy looks like. Right. And then we're going to define together workflows that create content. Like, I believe that your content is an output of your content system. Right. And like, you no longer want to be involved in creating the content. It's just an output of it. So you architect the system. You press a button. It creates all the content for you. Right. Then you have a way to like close the loop. So it's like self optimizing. Right. And you deploy that entire thing. But if you have on the cloud, what's the benefit of that? Well, firstly, you can just share it super easy with people that you work with like Crystal. But most importantly, you can plug it into any third party workflow you do. Like imagine you make an NAN workflow and then like you just add like a tool and it gets like the most up to date, like marketing content, like context that needs to trigger some whatever fucking workflow down the line. Like that's kind of how we're thinking about this entire system.

william: Yeah. Yeah, it's good. I like that. That's good. That's much needed. I'd love, I'd love to have something like that. Yeah.

alexander: I mean, that's kind of what I've got from a lot of these agencies. They're like, I've saw this pattern where a lot of the agencies said the exact same thing. And I was like, what are you, like, how are you doing this today? And they're just like, oh, I'm paying like fucking six different subscriptions across like Chash BT Claude and stuff. And I'm trying to figure out how to use NAN, but it's fucking bullshit and hard. And I kind of just gave up and I'm just doing like this, this kind of thing. So it's like a state of customer that I've seen over and over again. And I'm just like, okay, this seems like a real need. Right. And, uh, yeah. Yeah.

william: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's good. Um, going, going back to the, uh, okay. So going back to the content strategy. So we define kind of like, you know, just to like, I understand like, okay, what about how you're approaching it? I hope you get a bit of a sense. And again, I stopped at the point. I probably give you a very blurry idea of how, how I'm, I'm, I'm approaching the personal brand. Um, I, I, I don't know how I have to go through web three and talk about what three bullshit. Um, and had those conversations, but I want to make it more on two things really. AI workflows.

alexander: Yeah.

william: But I want to be very careful on like, talk about AI workflows, but not be very careful on like, you know, I'm not making AI stuff because there's a tab, a lot of people, and a lot of people are even say, you know, they, some people even like lie and they say like, you know, like, well, I don't use it that much and blah, blah, blah. Right. You write my stuff. I think it's bullshit. I think Twitter right now is like 80, 90%. It may sound human. I mean, but it's, it's, it's, you're using some sort of LOM, I think to generate content. Um, that being said, so where does this lead us? Maybe once we get to, I think like, let's, let's get to a point where we're at. We've finished maybe the computer analysis and then we've got the brand fundamentals fully done in terms of, okay, this is, this is kind of how we, this is good. This is like kind of like where we want it. Competitor analysis at that point. Then go back and start to like, think about actually writing it, telling, telling our story. It may be two different lenses, right? Yeah. You on, let's say the, um, again, kind of like the, the architect lens. Me on like, I'm building this in terms of this is how I like approach it. Uh, or like this is how I'd approach the steps of the marketing and stuff. Right. And this is kind of like also using cursor, using all that stuff. What were the challenges? Kind of like these kinds of mini case studies, but story based. That's so like, you know, um, so what, what, what, what are the count content outputs? I'm thinking on my end. Yeah. Substack. It sounds like you have, you already, you know, doing a Substack or you think I'm doing what I, have you done or are you, are you doing, you, you have,

alexander: I think you've written some stuff. Yeah.

UNKNOWN: Yeah.

william: Um, so content articles. Yeah. Tweets. Right. Around the two kind of like, and then looking to the Substack. Are you, are, is it just Twitter? Uh, like for socials

alexander: or are you, are you doing YouTube? Uh, well, I'm, I need to probably hire someone to help me with video editing on YouTube. I do know that YouTube, so the, for me, the priority is Twitter. I don't kind of want to crack Twitter for me, which is like a thousand, 2000 followers and get to that point. And then I would like move on and focus my full time on another platform, having like, kind of like not automated Twitter, but kind of figured it out a little bit. Right. So I'm fully dedicated to where at the moment.

william: Okay. Yeah. We are. We are in Twitter. Like what do you mean?

alexander: I'll automate it. But I mean like having understood what actually moves the needle in terms of Twitter content versus not because right now I'm still like very experimental, um, at the moment. Okay. And I really have like, um, a habit or a routine for creating Twitter content, which I think you'd have to get to. Yeah.

william: Yeah. Yeah. There's, that's also what, yeah. Because I have some ideas around that. The thing with Twitter, I, and I like your approach in terms of like, you know, scraping, let's say the high -performing tweets and stuff, but that, I think that's one, one good thing as a reference. Um, but also it's like, yeah. Yeah. Also like there's, Twitter could be a grind, like fucking, just like what works really well. And it's a grind and you can't really automate it because Twitter is good at blocking it is being a reply guy. Don't underestimate. You know what a reply guy is?

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can totally, I totally see that. Be really engaging with your community and stuff for sure.

william: Yeah. Like, like even like high, like top three, like boring marketer, right? When you post, comment on it, like be the first, be the first. It's just like, I don't know how, how much engagement, I'm sure he has good engagement, but like web three, a good reply guy, it's a fucking grind. But like, they're like the fucking, like, they're like the unsung heroes.

alexander: Right. In

william: marketing,

alexander: you know?

william: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and we, we, we implement that in for what we try just for a certain brand. And it works really well to even build up brand accounts. So that's one thing. Um, in terms of like, if like, I, I don't like, I don't do a lot of video, like interviews and stuff. I don't do any, actually. I'm saying any, I don't do it. I don't do it. I, I, and it's more about not having that as a focus. And also like, I don't like, I, I, I don't, I'm not a shy person at all. Especially when, when I talk to you, I'm not, cause like no one's ever become shy. I can talk and this and that, but when it comes to like posting videos online, all of a sudden I get shy,

alexander: you know, it's like a different. Yeah. Yeah. I said you're a human.

william: Yeah. Like, I mean, I, I don't know if you're like, you sent me a video in the past year. So it sounds like you're somewhat comfortable. Could you, you send me some, some Instagram account and you're like on video

alexander: and stuff. Um, I'm very comfortable with the, with being on camera. I'm completely fine on camera. There's actually a very interesting thing that happened to me on the weekend. I get a very experimental Twitter at the moment. I literally upload a photo of me, the gym, like just in my own personal space, just saying some random shit. And like a client, like potential client reached out to me. Right. And I asked him like in the middle of the first five minutes, like, Hey, by the way, why did you reach out? He was like, Oh, you uploaded like a photo at you, the gym. And I was like, the fuck. And he was like, yeah, you're a human. Like, it was nice to see that you were just an actual guy and you weren't just like fucking like a random. And I was like, yeah. And then he was like, yeah, then you had all these workflow videos and you're breaking them down. And it's just like a loom video. Right. It was like super authentic. And he was like, yeah, I really like, I really liked that. And I was just like, okay, yeah, fair enough. Like, so I'm trying to be as just confident on camera and just like put myself out there. And I really don't give a fuck to me. I don't give a shit what anyone really thinks online. I've done some cringy stuff before. It makes no difference to me. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

william: Yeah. Which is, which is very good. That's, that's the attitude that, that, that, that, that is, I think it's very good. That's the attitude that I, I, I need to do. I need, I need to develop for online stuff. Like I'm, I, I get it. It's, it's not like I'm, it's not a confidence thing. It's, well, maybe it is for, for, for only for posting online. That's the thing.

alexander: Yeah. But

william: my point is, is this, that's not an excuse. I've, I, I can get over it probably really quickly if I put my, you know, if I actually focus on it. So why I'm saying this is that, um, let's, yeah, we'll take a, like, like we, we can start to think about content. Maybe after like comp analysis, get that sorted out and it starts to say, okay, let me write, let's say the first part, let me declare this on, maybe on Twitter or so. Yeah. And declare this on a sub stack, get them, get some momentum. How about comp analysis? What I think we, I think we vibe really well, just, just in talking and chatting and stuff, but also just the ideas, compliments and just kind of like, you know, like the perspectives and everything. And I think however you want to do it, again, it could be video. Again, don't like any sort of, one thing I don't do is any sort of bottleneck I have, I don't let that or barrier mental block. I don't allow that to control the goal. Sure.

alexander: Right.

william: So for example, videos and stuff, I'll, I'll do it. I'll, I'll get over it, you know, and, and, and, and that'll be a big deal. So if you want to do it, say, I don't know what you're thinking. If video is part of this strategy and built in public or not, like

alexander: a

william: podcast or, or I'm not saying podcasts, I'm saying like, whether it's some sort of video talking about it. And like, it's like a segment of like, you know, an added segment of, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes, but it's like good stuff.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Or it's, it's a Twitter space that gets recorded. Or we have like a mini, again, I'm not pushing podcasts here. I'm just throwing out a music, a mini podcast series doesn't get a long, like, like a six, eight parter, right. That people can still reference based on this building public project. Like I'm open to it. I'm, I'm not saying one specific thing. Cool.

alexander: What are your thoughts on it? I'm completely open to that. I think, I think it's really, really good. I think what promotes authenticity is important. I'm again with you, I'm super transparent as to what my objectives are. You know, where I'm trying to bring this, you know, how my approach of like, I'm trying to take the approach to it. Like having us be in line with that. I think I'm curious to see like your perspective on where you guys can extract the most value from positioning yourselves as the content, like architects. I'm not just curious if you've thought about that, like really deeply and how you're going to leverage that. Um, yeah. If you have any thoughts off that in the back of that.

william: Yeah. Well, I think I, I, I, I really think, well, I would definitely have some of that messaging in, in my content in the sense that like, this is the new way of approaching marketing. Yeah.

alexander: Cause

william: I, I personally believe it. I think I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't. Of course.

alexander: I agree. Yeah.

william: Yeah. So it'd be coming and it's coming from, let's say, um, yeah, like maybe like there's, there's obviously gonna be maybe some reference to non -citizen. I'm not, I don't plan to show non -citizen, like in, in some, in some ways, more about looting it. The way that Crystal does it, she doesn't show it. She has her own podcast. We're starting it up called the builder's ledger, which is more about profiling, you know, let's say popular people in the web three space and talking about more about the human story and how it connects with what they're building. Not so much about infrastructure and what they're building first. It's human first and the thing, which is a bit of a twist on what most of these podcasts do in web three.

alexander: Anyways,

william: point I'm trying to make is that I would approach it for, um, two things. How to approach web three, let's say, or not web three, marketing. Um, approach marketing because we're not just doing content again. We actually haven't touched content. It's been like a week, two weeks or so.

alexander: Yeah. Right.

william: Where we're, it's like, how do we use AI in a very, let's say discipline and methodical way to get very good outputs through AI where a brand fundamentals, we know it can't be 100 % done with AI. Sure. Okay. But can it be, can it give it an 80%, very good 80 % starting point. Mm -hmm. And now that human loop for brand fundamentals becomes 20%. Yeah. So what does it do? It increases the time and probably increases the output to get that 20 % so we can move on to comp analysis, right? Sure. Before AI and all that stuff, a good comp analysis can take, I don't know, like it depends. Sometimes it takes a week, sometimes it takes two weeks. Yeah. Some agencies come and, you know, some people take a month, do a proper comp analysis.

alexander: Right? Yeah. Yeah.

william: But can you get, let's say that very thorough part. And again, messaging about like how much is too much. Mm -hmm.

alexander: And I

william: think that's a big thing that I've been battling about. Like, you know, it gets to a point of like diminishing returns for like, you know, for every three, four hours you spend, maybe get maybe a 2 % better output. Sure. But like, does it really matter?

alexander: Yeah. Right? Because

william: you have to consider about time, energy, you know, resources, et cetera. Right? So why to do, and I'm kind of going on deviation. I want to approach it in terms of, this is also very much aligned to your messaging. This whole approach of marketing is this new wave, new age of marketing.

alexander: Sure.

william: And it's, it's, it's, it's about thinking about marketing as an architect, but also as it's a, as you put it, a vibe marketer. So it's both like, I think a good marketer, a very good marketer will have those two components of that crack, very good marketer. They'll understand how to build an architect, the system, but they also will be able to go in and understand what is actually good, what isn't, but still that doesn't replace understanding the fundamentals of marketing, which I still think you have to learn that. Sure.

alexander: Yeah. I think the dynamic that we have should really be put front and center because it's fucking interesting. Like I would love to see, like, it's a super interesting combination, you know? And I, and I, for me, I want to put that out there. Um, but yeah, you just want to be a hundred percent aligned with you. I think we are in terms of like the principles. I think it might be worthwhile crane, like kind of like core principles of fundamentals that we're going to approach. Like one that we've already been very clear that we both believe in, fuck AI slop. And we're very, very like, like, uh, invested in human loop kind of workflows that enable like really best output that we can get. And I think that's, as an agency, it's like a prerequisite for you. And I don't want to build anything that creates AI slop. Like, it's just, it's not even like a principle of mine. It's just, I have no interest in it. I know I won't want to wake up in the morning and I'll send you my website when it's done. I have a very like deep story as to why I'm so invested in content creation. And it's like, it really goes back to like my parents and stuff and they're like media professionals going back years. And I think it's an interesting story to tell. So I'm going to tell that story out there like very publicly as well. Um, but yeah, for me, I'm very like emotionally involved in this in the sense that like, uh, I don't care about really about the means. It's more like I'm on a mission pretty much. If that makes sense. And, uh, if there's money to be made off of this, all the better, you know? And I think there is, I think this is a huge field. I would, I would push you to just fucking imagine because right now, like the overconfidence is much better than anything else. I think in today's day and age when shit is changing so quickly. So you might as well be optimistic and ambitious.

william: Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I, I, I definitely see the direction. This is where it's headed to be honest. So, okay. So, so next we'll do comp analysis. Um, I, I, I think that, that, that kind of maybe putting on paper some values, some, some sort of, let's say some values around the content strategy, you know, like what you were referring to. Sure. And the mission, the values kind of like, you know, what we kind of stand for. Yeah.

alexander: It's a good way,

william: actually. We're kind of already doing our own brand fundamentals for this content strategy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as elaborate, but just, you know, things on paper, so we align and then, yeah. Then we, then we think about how to do that. Sure. Um, yeah. Cool. Okay, cool. Sounds good. All right. Um, so Wednesday, same time.

alexander: Wednesday, same time. And I'll have the framework ready for you. So we can, uh, play around with it and see how the, it helps us with the brand fundamentals. That's the goal. Just get the brand fundamentals out. Then we move to the comp.

william: Yeah.

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Excited. Good. Okay.

william: Thanks.

alexander: See you then. Thanks Alex. Bye bye. Bye bye.

william: Bye bye. Thank you.
