william: I broke this to like three phases, right? This is kind of like maybe, I don't know, if you want to call it an MVP or something. There's obviously more extensions to this. I have like, obviously, we, as we're talking, we have a lot of ideas that can branch off off of this, but obviously we have to have the foundation in the floor first, right? That's always, you know, like before we do like the fancy stuff and the cool stuff, this is how it all works. So show my screen. Anyway, okay. So here, the idea here is this. Broke it down to three phases. Phase one, foundation. Phase two, content generation. Phase three, optimization, kind of this brain intelligence part of the thing, right? The logic is pretty simple. To do phase two, you need phase one, right? That's how you generate a lot of the content. There's obviously more to it, but, you know, you need that foundation of understanding. And then the phase three is more like, okay, how do we optimize this? How do we introduce things like, obviously, like the RAC system? Let's say, train it on different variations of different, let's say, specific niche books that we can get better insight, et cetera. You know, memory system. Also analyzing our performance, analyzing that analysis part of it, right? Kind of like creating our own kind of AI report card or self, kind of like almost in some ways, creating, let's say, a master guide and expert, right? I know you can prompt it saying, hey, you're an expert in marketing or content creation, right? I don't know how, like, I know that's decent, but to be an expert on very niche things and go really deep while still understanding the full context of the actual client and what you're doing is something you can't do from like a general LLM, right? And prompting that stuff, right? So that's how I was kind of like thinking about these three phases. Now, if we go into phase one, and I want to like also tell you, like, this is how I generally approach this pre -LLMs and even with LLMs, right? With AI, I still approach it this way, right? But I've been doing this kind of like manually with LLMs in the sense that to get brand fundamentals, you know, understanding that, yeah, there has to be a workshop involved and there's a lot of research involved, right? LLMs have just made my manual work a lot quicker, but it's still very much manual. And again, I'm not saying that, you know, there still isn't a manual work, even with cursor and all this stuff. It's more about how can we get to the next level and make this even more streamlined, right?

alexander: That's

william: the idea. So the first phase before we get to phase two is really getting the phase one, right? Now there's a few approaches and this is where I'm going to pick your brain. My intuition, based on even just like my, you know, my experience working manually with these LLMs is that you can't have, and I think you alluded to this in our previous conversation, you can't have some like master prompt, really spend hours on some crazy, maybe spend a day making what people think, oh, this is my like, my God prompt of everything. And I can just like, put this in, I craft it, and then all of a sudden, it's going to give me like, you know, the best output. Typically, it doesn't work that way. And especially the longer the prompt, more detailed, it gets to a point where it actually makes things worse.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Yeah, I agree. Yeah. So if that's the case, that means that we have to kind of break down, like if these are four sections here, and again, I don't know if these are different types of prompts, but it's more about like, okay, what does brand fundamentals, what is this, right? How do you get this? There's, the thing about like, for example, mission, vision stuff, that's very personal. That's very specific to the brand. So that is generally some of these questions, you can get, you can get an idea, sure, and you can maybe create some options, which is fine, that could be one angle. But you literally have to talk to the CEO, or the CMO, or whatever exec or stakeholder, the founder of the company, whoever it is, to generally ask, what is your mission? What is your vision? You know, like, like more very, very highly specific things, right? Then you get to target audience, where you can make some obviously really good, not say guesses, but assumptions of these are the target audiences, right? 90, 95%, they're going to be accurate. There's sometimes that 5 % for like, you didn't see, oh yeah, you know, here's an audience segment that I didn't think of, right? That they run a channel and focus on, right? Then you get to competitor analysis, where it's actually not so much about asking stakeholders about it. Yeah, okay, actually, that's not true. There is. Because, for example, Akave, I did it before, I did this competitive analysis before I even spoke to them. And despite my competitors technically being true, they had other competitors that they actually were more focused on, that weren't in my competitive analysis. That like, you know, the LLMs and me researching it kind of saw, these are the obvious ones, but there was some up and coming that the LLMs weren't picking up, or even I wasn't picking up, right? But then, what I'm trying to say here is that, even for competitor analysis, there's, let's say, a format. And I've done many different formats of comp analysis, right? Whether it's just like, a table format, sometimes it's legit, just like, legit, like 10 pages, breaking down every single competitor and stuff, right? There's different ways and flavors and how to do it. Like, more doesn't mean better. I'm starting to kind of like, over the last couple of months, especially, maybe even this year, start to really focus on impact versus length, right? Especially now where words and pages and just documents has been such a commodity, because now it's so easy to generate them. It's actually more about, how can you, how can you write a document that has the most impact, most valuable, that's also very digestible for people to read, right? So, but also in this sense, you know, let's say a competitor analysis, what's better? A high impact, highly viable, no redundancy, no overlap, even the words and everything is concise, not concise enough where it loses detail, concise enough where like, you're not, you know, your paragraphs are not overwinded, right? Or blown up, right? Five pages of that, of like a concrete competitor analysis, or 20 pages, that's a little bit more in depth, may not have this. And maybe the impact in terms of that, that the depth of knowledge is the same as a five, that five pager, but maybe you're adding too much context, or maybe it's, you know, what's, what's better in your opinion, in an LLM point of view?

alexander: I mean, I guess my first question is, the brand fundamentals, clear analysis, content strategy, tone of voice, how do you represent them today? Like, if you're going through all the manual work yourself, how is like the deliverable of this work being represented? In

william: a Google Doc.

alexander: In a Google Doc, so that you have four different Google Docs at the end of this.

william: So, for, okay, so good question. For example, brand fundamentals and, okay, so I would typically do brand fundamentals, one document, competitor analysis, another document, and then content strategy. Yeah, it would be separate documents. Tone of voice could be a bit different, because that kind of goes more, sometimes I put that to content strategy, right? Sometimes I leave it, and then I just basically combine all the documents and send it to the client and stuff. I also pull this, pull this into LLMs, right, for that context, and then I can start generating stuff.

alexander: Okay. And just to clear, what was your actual, like, question here? Were you asking what's the best way to represent this so it interacts with LLMs?

william: Well, the question there, there's a few, yeah, so there's a few questions here. One specific question is, should we define, I don't want to, I don't want to say word length, I don't want to make a straight jacket in terms of word length or documents, but define some sort of criteria where, like, what is enough? You know, and one is, like, it's, like, it's to the point where it doesn't, it doesn't matter anymore, and it might actually hurt our cause in terms of giving the LLMs too much. Because you also have to think about things with limitations and context windows, for example, right? And, like, if we want to approach it as being, like, super optimized as much as we can in the beginning, at least thinking about it, you know, in this scenario of, like, competitor and market analysis, right? If we were to break that down, okay, we need to have, let's say, some sort of structure so that we can actually make this output as best as possible. Is that, let's say, and I'm using this as an example, I'm not saying it has to be a five -page document, it could be a few -page document, I don't know, right? Or if it's a 20 -page document, should we define the structure of each document, right? And then also define how much is too much?

alexander: Yeah, I mean, I would always lean towards being opinionated. So what that means is, like, you should have an idea of what good looks like before going into the workflow or whatever prompt that you're basically using. So if you're going into it, we have, like, this, like, foundational onboarding session, which requires three different workflows, for example. And when I say workflow, I don't mean, like, an NAN workflow. I mean, like, a combination of that. So, like, the human loop kind of aspect, the one that you're doing in Cursor, where you're having a conversation with it, you're talking about the brand, you're giving the inputs, it's triggering some MCP tools, coming back with you with information, you like it, like, the other day, when you did it, you're like, oh, I didn't know that that was a competitor, and you found out something new, all right? Then you might want to dive more into that, all that kind of stuff, right? But before going into that session, I think you should have a good idea as to what you're trying to get out of it. Because then you're kind of leaving the door open for, like, the agent to firstly get confused. So it might, like, go down a random rabbit hole and just generate a document, which is, like, competitive analysis of a specific target customer or a specific company, right? So you come out with, like, 30 different files at the end of the kind of workflow that you're working in, right? So, like, a structured way of basically saying, like, by the end of this workflow, we expect these three documents, you're setting a goal, right? So the entire time the AI agent is going through his entire process along with you, so you're giving the input it needs to kind of tailor it and, as you mentioned, scope it down based on what you actually care about and like. But you actually deliver on the goal of the end, and then you just have these three files that come out of it. Does that answer your question, or should I be more specific?

william: Well, I mean, it does, and then it comes to, like, okay, so maybe I have, like, how do I put this? If I give, I mean, this is why I don't know, like, this agentic workflow where you kind of give these agents the tools, and then they give it the objective or the goal, and they go on with these instructions or, you know, whatever they need to do to complete that goal. Sure. If I give it right here, let me just, like, give you a concrete example. If I give it right here, let me just put down all this stuff, positioning statement, you've got the value propositions and the pillar mapping, right, so you basically define where the value propositions, how do you kind of bucket these value propositions into different brand pillars? Yeah. Which will then eventually you connect that to the target audience, more so in terms of target motivation, like audience motivations, like buying motivations, I'm saying. Emotion, and then you've got the emotional node star, this is good for also generating content in the future, creative content or so, what emotions you want to invoke in your campaigns that resonate with the audience. Competitor analysis is, again, all this stuff, right? So I broke down all these ideas in terms of, like, what do these, what does pillar mapping mean? How do you actually go about it? What questions do you ask? What do you take out from that? Now, if I were to give this to, if I were to design a prompt, which probably this would be, like, 70 % of the prompt, maybe, you know, 80%, and then say I need, in one go, can an agentic agent, given whatever tools they have, scraping Twitter now, like Twitter listing, or, you know, using different LLMs for different purposes, et cetera, would this be too much for an agent to do in one bank?

alexander: It will do it, but you won't like the output.

william: Right.

alexander: The reason why you won't like the output is because this requires a multi -step workflow where you have interjections throughout it where you're kind of assessing its output, tracking it, seeing where it is so far, having a conversation with it, asking you questions, right? So, what I showed you, that markdown workflow file, the one that you have within your cursor, what it's done is it's broken down kind of the delivery of these three documents, because you're creating three strategy documents. It's told you what prompts you want to use at each step. It's broken down into four steps, right? And once you expect the end of each step, and it's giving you the final goal of the entire kind of workflow, right? That leads to significantly better outputs. And the reason why that leads to, firstly, you've broken it down into several steps, right? Which is, as any human would do in this case, when you have, you're asking to deliver all this. But then, secondly, you're giving it the opportunity to output stuff, and you, as the operator, come in and be like, this isn't right. Or, there's something interesting there about this comparator. Let's dive in deeper into the comparator, right? But you want to scope it in a way so you prevent it from just creating random jargon, marked -out files randomly, which is what it does if you don't kind of design the thing well enough. But that's my responsibility, essentially.

william: Right. Okay. So, got it.

alexander: Sorry, got it. Do you understand the general gist of, like, workflows that kind of break this down? And you work, like, you go through the process initially of breaking it down into, like, a marked -out file or whatever you want to do, right? And then you kind of design the prompts so that you're happy with them initially. Then once it's done, you just save it in the same place, and that's a repeatable file. So, the point is not to get, like, how do you do no work? The point is that if you do work once and it works well, you never have to do it again.

william: Or you significantly streamline it. Mission, vision, value, this is kind of very, I don't think LLM's really, I mean, you can, but this is not so much, this is more of a human thing. Audience, this, I think, I've had a lot of good results from this understanding audiences, motivations, buying, like, demographics. I don't, I put demographics here, but, like, like, demographics is very misleading. It's, it's more psychographics, more motivations, right? Like, you know, you can have three very different demographics, but they can all share very similar buying motivations, right? So, so understanding motivations in that sense, would that be a workflow as well? Like, would these be, I get, my one question is, if there's one section here for brand fundamentals and another one for competitive market analysis, these are two sections. But in these sections, you've got these subsections, right? You've got, you know, these sections and underlines for each big one. Would a workflow be the full brand fundamentals or would a workflow be the subsections? It

alexander: would be the full brand fundamentals, right? Because you define a workflow by what you want the end delivery to be, right? So the steps within the workflow, and by the way, I define a workflow by a single contact session, right? So each workflow, when you go into a chat agent with a cursor or Claude, each workflow is within the contact session, right? Because each session represents a context that's shared across the entire conversation. And it's limited to a hundred, it's limited to 120 ,000 token, right? So you realistically don't want to do, like, five workflows in a row in the same session, because you're going to run out tokens, it's going to start hallucinating, and it's just going to perform worse. So workflow that defines the output of the session, and then you kind of move across that way, and you go down step by step, and you use the prompts. Exactly like the workflow markdown file that I have. That workflow markdown file can be significantly improved by breaking it down to three separate workflows, because in that single one, I'm doing, like, content strategy, tone of voice, target audience, all that kind of stuff, which is too fair as possible to do in a single workflow file. I think it's still going to get, you know, a lot further than you would by itself, but it would perform a lot better if you did this one by one.

william: So when you're going back to the comment about 120k context window, is this, like, just by this, would this one of this brand fundamentals workflow be enough for 120k context window? Oh, yeah,

alexander: absolutely. Like,

william: comfortably, for sure. Okay.

alexander: And

william: then you're saying that, if it goes, so does it, I mean, technically, everything's a hallucination, right? Like, any prompt that you guys detect, it's always a hallucination. But then when you say that, like, it starts to go beyond more, that 120k, now it starts to hallucinate, you're saying that it starts to, like, let's say, forget things, or forget context.

alexander: Yeah, because I think you have the expectation that it remembers perfectly the first line that you've inputted. So you, you'll see it with Chattery T, right? If you say at the beginning of the conversation, my name is Alexander, right? Talk to it for a really long period of time, then ask it, like, at the middle point, what's my name? It'll say Alexander. But if you ask at the end point, what's my name? Like, I don't know.

william: Because

alexander: you pass the context session.

william: Yeah, and I remember your diagramming your example of, like, how, like, it, it, there's, like, a window, and it just keeps going down, right? Yeah. So when, when it gets to that point, that means, like, when it gets to the point where it doesn't remember your name from the first statement of, if you being, calling, like, you know, saying you're Alexander, it means that it went, it went past the threshold of its context window. And now, okay. Okay, understood. So now tell me where, where, where, where to begin here, and how to navigate this, because, so I have this, this is kind of like how I approach the first part of, let's say, working with, with the brand, even if they have this stuff, which is great, it kind of helps me out in terms of understanding how they, like, you know, the context of, let's say, their audience and blah, blah, blah, their mission, vision, all that stuff, value propositions. But let's say, like, for example, let's do a real world example. We have this client, like I, like I mentioned, they're Akave. They're a bit weird, not weird, but they're a bit different, or it's a bit strange, the situation, because they have Akave network, which is this Akave network on this blockchain, and then they moved over to another blockchain, and now they're, they have this product called Akave Cloud, right? Now, the difference between Akave network and Akave Cloud, and this is more, this is more like their, their, their decision to do this, they're trying to, like, promote both, but their flagship product is Akave Cloud. But the weird thing is, is that the Akave Cloud's technically a blockchain as well. Don't, I'll get to, it's, it's like, it doesn't make, yeah, it's, it's, um, Seems like they're distracted. Sorry?

alexander: It seems like they're distracted, or don't want to put all their eggs in one basket.

william: Yeah, yeah, and, and, and, and also too, it's, it's, it, it, it, it complicates, let's say, uh, brand messaging, when people are like, well, what's Akave network versus Akave, it's like, then can't they do everything on Akave Cloud, if it's also a blockchain, like, you know, Akave network, but that's, that's really beyond our control, and, you know, the point I'm trying to make is that, they just announced out Akave Cloud, like, we, um, like, legit, like, two, three weeks ago. Yeah, around that, roughly around that time. Um, and we're making a big push for Akave Cloud. Akave network is, like, something that we're focused on. I have a bunch of information that I pretty much went through this process back in, like, earlier this year for Akave network. Now, even though there is overlap, and I could still use that information, there's still new information for Akave Cloud. I have to, I basically have to redo this whole process, right? The thing is, is that also, this client, they're not, let's say, like, we've been asking them for more documentation, right? We understand why Akave Cloud is on a high level, what they do and what their product is, but, you know, usually when you do a product release, you have a lot of documentation to bring the product release, right? Right. They don't have that, um, which makes it difficult for us to kind of, you know, um, maybe develop this as best as we can. But that, but, but, but I still want to do it, right? And I think this is a good application to do this. So, vision, vision, values, all that stuff, I can do that. That's, that's going to be pretty much the same as Akave network. Audience, relatively the same. Okay, so the, the question is that, like, let's use this use case as, like, this structure and based on, like, this whole agenda workflow and stuff to build out Akave, Akave Cloud's, both the foundation and then content generation. And then we can use this information for the intelligence, the phase three intelligence, right? I think this would be like a good use case working example, real world, up actual real client, where we can actually, right now, actually produce. And use this workflows for them, right? Um, and, and do this. So I guess this would be, let's say the main project, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, so how do you want to approach this? I got cursor, like the, the upgrade, I, even though I got the ProTrial, I just upgraded. So I have like all the, all the bells and whistles of the, you know, the clot and everything. Um, how do you want to approach this? So I think it

alexander: will be best to kind of try the workflow approach. Um, and it's in the capacity that I did the markdown file for the strategy stuff, right? So we go by like one by one and quite work through with the cursor thing. It has access to fire crawl, has access to perplexity. You and I just work like side by side so that it starts generating some of these files. And then we kind of like make sure that we're happy with the output that it's trying to get. Now it complicates things a little bit because usually I go into it with like a workflow and we need to basically break this down into a workflow. But we can simplify this for the sake of just, you know, for testing purposes. And I think you're still going to get 80 % of the way there, right? If we go into the session saying like we need to create a brand fundamentals, right? Then we design a prompt together so you see how like what a good prompt looks like. We think about what tools it might want to act have access to to perform the different objectives of this workflow. And then we see the output of content together. And then once we have the output of content together, like the brand fundamentals, if you just scroll down in your document there, I see like the brand fundamentals being a dependency of competitor and market analysis. Because you want to be able to basically just be like slash at brand fundamentals. Let's read this to understand who our brand is, what it is, what's the point, all that kind of stuff. And then let's perform market analysis and you give it the right prompt, right? And then, you know, then you take the competitive analysis, the market analysis, whatever, brand fundamentals and you just did the same thing with the content strategy. So we're kind of building up on work that's already done. And we're just kind of using a workflow like step -by -step workflow. So it's like super clean and done effectively. And then by the end of this session, ideally we come out with like three of these documents and you kind of have a better idea of what I mean by these workflows. And you see how the perplexity API was being used, the fire crawl API was being used. And then we kind of get a good idea of what's a good prompt, bad prompt. And we kind of iterate from there. And the goal is to have those three documents or four documents that you mentioned so that we can start pulling it in to the content creation process we do later on, right? Because what you want to do is you want to generate a tweet idea or whatever. Let's just take Twitter, for example. Then it's just like, hey, the tone of voice is shit here. Like it doesn't reflect our tone of voice well at all. Generate 20 variations, but at the tone of voice file, ensure that it's in line with that. That moves a lot of the work away from like having to copy paste all the shit into cursor or into chat with T again or whatever into a single place. And then you focus on the prompting. And then you just make sure you do it away where the prompting is done once. Because let's say we do the Twitter workflow after, right? We have these four files and we want to generate a good tweet. We might find that there's like a workflow that we perform that acts, that really responds well in terms of creating great tweets where it's like, hey, I want to create this tweet. Let's break it down to a three -step process. Like what's the hook? That could be step one. You know, what's the value proposition? That could be step two. We talk about it. And then, you know, tone of voice, align it with this document. Then you have a tweet. Then you turn that into a workflow file. So it's done again. You don't have to like reuse the prompt. Does that

william: make sense to you? Yeah. Yeah, it does. Cool. Like, yeah, yeah, it does. So how do you want to approach, let's say the first part, the brand fundamentals? I think we just jump in a cursor and then we just, we just vibe,

alexander: mark it.

william: Okay. Okay. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. So I'm going to share my, you want me to share my screen? Sure. Okay. Okay. So I have cursor up here. Okay. So yeah, Akave brand. So I'm going to pull up. See, this is the thing, right? I could pull up. I have some Akave documentation that, like I told you, the stuff that I did, right? Should we, should we go from scratch?

alexander: How relevant?

william: Because like here, it's, yeah, this is the thing. There is, there's overlap and there's, it is relevant, right? The problem is, is that if I go with those documentations and then I start to pull that into the LLMs, the LLMs are going to start to think that everything's relevant, right? It's going to maybe get, it's, it might be misleading is what I'm trying to say. Gotcha. You know? So maybe like, for example, if I go to Akave cloud, for example, Akave .cloud, like, like basically they're just, they're just like, they're cloud storage for enterprise, right? And I think you can still pull it from their website, even though it's not that, it's not here, let me, let me show you my screen. Like this, this is their, their site. Their documentation is a lot of Akave network. There is documentation for Akave cloud, but it's very technical. I don't know how, how helpful that's going to be in a marketing point of view, but really like, for example, like, you know, they've got these as like, you know, like, like, like these are, these, I guess you can synthesize in some ways they are like the, the UVP's unique value propositions. Um, maybe we can use this as a signal and extract this in terms of extract these ideas, and then start to build out and ask the questions in that, that blueprint, the foundation blueprint that I have, and start to kind of expand on that. Do you think this is a, my first question is, despite this being, you know, not, not the most, even, even their FAQ is very like simple, like very, very simple. Do you think this is enough information to, to have a starting point?

alexander: Absolutely. To have a starting point for sure, because we're going to say, look at the blog, look at the website, scrape it, pull the information in, all that kind of stuff. It's going to give it context. It's going to give it an understanding of what it does. And then where the human loop kind of comes in is just like, this is not enough, whatever. Let's give it other sources and to learn more about it. Or let's say you just have a transcript from a call you had, right? Which is very possible. Just chuck it in and be like, okay, read this transcript. This gives you more context. What have you learned from this transcript? That kind of stuff.

william: Yeah. Okay. Cool. Okay. All right. So let's go back to this right here. I'm going to go back to cursor and then, um,

alexander: So I think first things first, uh, press the ellipses button in the top right corner, like for the chat. So you can just see if the MCPs are activated, the one right below it. Yeah, there you go. Nice. The one that you're hovering over a second ago. Yeah, that click that and chat settings. So it's just good practice to do the beginning of each session. And then go to tools integrations on the left hand nav. Okay, cool. All right. So everything's actually, so yeah, that's just, that's just good practice at the beginning of every session. Just do this. So you can check if everything's working correctly and everything's connected. It'll be red. If it's not connected. Okay. Cool. All

william: right. Cool. So, okay. So if I were to do a new chat here,

alexander: uh, then I just

william: go look here, new chat.

alexander: Okay.

william: So

alexander: see what's in context right now is the Akave cloud research report. Did we do that before? Or was that you?

william: I don't, I don't think I did this. Did I? Oh, maybe we did this to like in our last session. Okay. Oh yeah. I think we did. Yeah. Um, that's fine. Okay. Do I just do it from, from, from scratch again? Just

alexander: like, yeah. You delete it or just take it out context with you.

william: I'm just going to delete this.

alexander: Okay. I think, so what you actually did, which was pretty cool. I'm looking at now you kind of gave the template of what you're trying to achieve in this, um, brand fundamentals. So you know what you can do is you can go into the left hand side there and create a new file and you can call brand fundamentals underscore template dot markdown.

william: It's like brand fundamentals template.

alexander: Yeah. Then dot MD. So first it's a good practice, by the way, for when you do a cursor, it's more a programming thing, but whatever. It's fine. Um,

william: dashes,

alexander: it underscores underscores and no, and no capitalized, uh, letters. So it's like brand underscore fundamentals underscore template. It, it just avoids like complexity down the line in terms of.

william: Yeah. I, I, I used to do this with dashes, but we can do like, uh, but yeah. Okay.

alexander: Yeah.

UNKNOWN: Okay.

alexander: Just sometimes the computer won't recognize that you'll say.

william: Yeah, but this space is right.

alexander: Yeah. So then

william: I would

alexander: just call you paste your, your template in there. The one that you basically outlined in the things you're trying to achieve from the brand fundamentals website, um, research. Nice. Cool. Okay. So let's just, uh, I'll try just to think of props top of my head. Right. Um, I'm trying to think where the human input comes in. Oh, oh,

william: sorry. There's, there's, there's one that, yeah, there's one thing I was gonna, to mention too, because is, should we define, so like, should we have like a file or, I don't know if it's a file or something, but somehow define, let me see, let me just go back to, to the screen. Like define, define the LLM attitude. So for example, um, I've like, like, I, I don't know if you noticed this is like, like the last, especially the last couple of months, like the, the chat GPT or, or whatever cloud and stuff, it's very agreeable.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Right. And like, it's agreeable to a point where like, at first you think, oh my God, I'm just, I'm like, you know, I'm amazing. It thinks everything, I'm so like, I'm so like, smart and brilliant. Right. And I started to realize it's always saying that, right. I'm not saying, I'm saying, I'm putting all this smart and brilliant stuff. I'm saying that it's always on the air side of complimenting. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Which is okay. Like, fine. That that's great. But it's like, I don't, I don't care for the compliment. Right. I don't care for, I actually want the opposite. I want, I wanted to play double, whether it's double as advocate or be objective, be critical. Right. Don't give me a fluff. Like I, like I would say, don't give me a fluff. Just like, you know, like if I'm saying something that is, let's say, like, there's a blind spot or like, I'm not seeing the full picture here, or there's something, there's an angle here that I'm not considering, or there's a better idea, tell me like, you know, I have to specify that. And even when I specify that, it starts to give me more of, let's say, a harsh look, a harsh objective look and critical eye of, of what I'm doing. Right. But I have to prompt that all the time. Yeah. Right. I mean, don't give me fluff. Don't sugarcoat it. Just give me objective, you know, critical, almost here to the side of being cynical. Right. Sure. Um, should we have some sort of person also to, I realized that like, having the guidance, like for example, even saying things that say, be my guide or be the evaluator and stuff. It gives me a different perspective or angle or different outputs because of that. Right. I agree. So, so should we do that? Like in terms of like, I've defined, let's say, and you can say, oh, you're, you're an expert brand strategist. That's, that's, I think it's a starting part, but it's like, but who is this personality? Almost like, before you define the brand, you are defined that the brand who's LLMS, you almost have to define who you're working with as an LLM.

alexander: Yeah. I completely agree with you. So the way that you do that cursor is something called cursor rules. So you want to, we can create one right now if you want.

william: Yeah. Yeah. And we can see how the behavior changes on

alexander: the back of it. Cool. Yeah. So in your folder, then what you're going to do is you go to, sorry, in your left hand and that side for the file system, you can go to add a new file or where, where, where you kind of hover over to add a new file. You press add a new folder instead. You see right there on the right. Yeah. There we go. So press that and you go to type doc cursor. It's a bit weird. Yeah. Doc cursor. Nice. Then enter just to create the folder and then just drag it out. So it's in the kind of like a group directory. So just drag it down. Yeah. There we go.

william: Like find solid white like this.

alexander: Yeah, exactly. It'll pop it out. Yep. There we go. Cool. And then you're going to add another folder within the doc cursor folder and that's called rules. So just R U L E S. Right. And then within that, we're going to create a file. So this file, let's just call it like, uh, I don't know. Like L M guidelines with the underscore. Nice. And then dot MDC. This is, we're getting it to like rogue advanced cursor territory, which is cool. Nice. There we go. Create that.

william: What, what, what, what is this? He's down for

alexander: it. So it's a markdown file that cursor is kind of created that allows you to like define when your rules are being used. If that makes sense. So you'll, you'll see. I'm trying to make sure that I'm not screwing up, which is cursor rules. Yeah. There we go. Makes sense. And then you create a rule dot MDC. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Nice. So if you can just call me paste what I'm about to send you into the MDC file, I'm sending it to you on Slack, by the way. So you're going to call you paste

william: that. With, with those. Okay. Yeah. With the line, I guess. Yeah.

alexander: Cool. So what you're basically saying is like when to apply it. So we're going to put that as always applied to true. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You're, you're basically giving it like, and then let's just give it a description. Like these are the brand guideline rules that you should always follow when giving responses in the description section up there.

william: This right here. Yeah.

alexander: Nice. Cool. And then right below is we just defined in plain English, like how we wanted to react. Right. So you're like, you're going to use this rule to, to find the way that you kind of like interact with us or speak to us or whatever. Right. And then you kind of give it the kind of the, the guidelines. Now you are a marketing agent that has an IQ of 180 plus. Yeah. I'm talking,

william: I'm giving you

alexander: like, sorry, go ahead.

william: No. Okay. Like even that, like, like, like telling it that, right. Um, 180 Q plus, right. Yeah. Does it, will it, will it actually understand that? And actually, and, and again, like, does that even mean, I know that's a very specific, I know I'm not, I'm not trying to like, you know, like focus on that so much, but it's more about, okay, fine. 180 Q plus.

alexander: So, so let me just give you like an idea that there's like the mathematical explanation for it. And then there's just kind of like the, there's research. There's a shit ton of research on this where if you tell the model, you are the world's best software engineer, and then you just tell them all, you're the world's worst software engineer, it will behave differently. And it will legitimately improve its output in terms of being a good software engineer. And the reason why it's happening is because this is called like hyperspace, right. And it's like the way they represent these AI models is across like, just like thousands of dimensions, it's just not, it's all math, right, it's just numbers, but they basically represent it across a thousand dimensions. It's, it's just like just fucked up dimensional concept. But all you kind of have to understand is like, there's this constant of space that's going on. So, if you think about how the internet, like subreddit, let's just think of subreddit, for example, right, or just Reddit. There's sections of Reddit, which is like, about super rogue concepts, you're just thinking like you're like in some sort of universe, and there's like a cluster of planets and there's this area of Reddit is all about like, I don't know, fucking by marketing or the Epstein files or something, right, there's something going on in this area. And there's another area, which is like all about sports and football. So, it's this concept of like, these patterns are being reflected in certain areas of this like hyperspace, right. And what's super interesting, the AI models, is that since it's trained on all the internet, and we're not really deciding what goes into it, right, they're improving the model's code capabilities by giving it just good code and like ranking good and bad code. If you say good code, it will bring you to the area where good code exists in the hyperspace, and just operate within that. So, it's going to get like much, it's going to pull in better like information from the hyperspace area, if that makes sense, right. So, when you say you're a 180 IQ marketer, it's going to bring you to like the genius marketing realm, where like it's been trained on all the data on like fucking, I don't know, who are the genius marketers from our time, going back, what's the guy who created the one in London, I don't know, just a few. Yeah, I mean, it's going to just think of like those guys, right. So, it will perform better. So, it's a super niche kind of interesting like outcome of it, but it actually makes a lot of sense mathematically when you look at it from that perspective.

william: Okay, okay. Yeah, I heard something on that note too. It's really weird. Maybe you've heard about it, that like if you threaten the LLM saying that your life's at risk, if you don't have like, you know, if you don't provide me like the best possible answer, like I will die, it actually does perform better. So, like to your point, it's, uh, yeah, yeah.

alexander: I just treat it like a human. It's like, it's like a human you can engineer. It's, it's a fucking weird concept, man.

william: The,

alexander: the thing, the

william: thing is that like, I, I, and, and like, even though it does make sense, it's like, okay, you want to like, make sure that you're giving instructions to be like, you know, superhuman or super intelligent, the biggest expert, you would think that like, then if, if it's so easy to prompt that, why don't they just make that the default state?

alexander: Because it doesn't want to be opinionated in the way that it kind of approaches it, if that makes sense, because you want to kind of give it the opportunity. There might be some information that you're looking for that's not in that kind of realm. Um,

william: like generic and vanilla, like that's the default state.

alexander: Yeah. I mean, imagine like, um, you don't want to do like marketing workflows and it's, and the whole thing is like, you're a genius AI marketer with a IQ 180 plus, and you just asked it for like the best recipe for cooking, you know, it's going to be weird. The output's going to be weird to like sell it to you.

william: Yeah. Yeah.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Okay. But they do have,

alexander: they do have system prompts, by the way, that like tools like lovable, for example, have like these God system prompts that are really, really impressive. And they do literally say in the prompts, like you are a world -class software engineer, that kind of stuff. It's very

william: interesting. Okay. That's good to know. Okay. Okay. So here, I wrote this down. Just something. This is kind of like my homework, right? Cause like, I, I, I want to do a few things for like, I want to make the sessions for like, I, I asked the questions and even when I do some things together, sure. Right. Like this, right. I actually want to sit down. Like for example, today, like, like, uh, like I'm going to another city, right. Like after this call, right. I got like a five hour bus ride. Right. I can totally just now spend an hour, two hours, maybe not the two hours to pick up this prompt specifically, but part of those two hours, just thinking about it, I can create a prompt on my phone and kind of think, okay, what would be a cool, like, what would be, let's say this LLM guideline .MDC, what would be that for the specific use case for marketing, for branding? You know? Um, however, question is this, these LLM guidelines for you that, right. Should we have one that is for everything or should we have one for each workflow?

alexander: So what's interesting about this, right. Is that cursor allows you to define LLM guidelines by the folder structure. So if you have a strategy folder, for example, like you have a brand folder and you could put like a rule within each folder. So anytime it does an operation within that folder, it applies like the global guideline, which we've just created here. But it could also apply like the folder guideline, if that makes sense, right? So it like, you could define how it like, it kind of reacts or works within different folders. So let's say we have a content folder whose entire purpose is to output deliverables, to output content, you know? So you could define that kind of rule by that folder. If there's a strategy folder, there's a different kind of prompt that's applied to it every time you interact with it.

william: So, so right now, like like right now, the full, this full structure is not set up the way you're talking about.

alexander: It's not. So what I'm actually doing now is I'm building out like this tool. There's no tool. It's, it's, it's, it's just a cursor. It's not an extension. It's literally the directory structure, right? With like built in rules and a way to apply workflow files so that, because I've been working in this kind of system for the last two months and I've, I've ran very hard into the limitations of it. But I also recognize that like, just because there's limitations to this file structure system doesn't mean you have to immediately jump to like crazy vector databases and creating like web apps and platforms, all that shit. And you know, it just gets really annoying. There's a, uh, an engineering way to approach this so that you kind of keep the beauty of like the simplicity of what we're doing now, but also get rid of the kind of limitations that come with it. So you're going to see a limitation that comes with this current state is that when we create like a file, it's going to start creating like more and more files and it's going to like expand past your scope or your ability to kind of like control all of them. Right? So if you have something new, like for a transcript and you want to update your strategy files, it tends to kind of create a new strategy file out of the blue, uh, instead of like updating the previous one all the time, that kind of stuff. So I'm kind of creating the guardrails around it without kind of moving away from this as an adding complexity. Um, so the file structure I need to figure out and I'm kind of like you and I will kind of design it together as well to see what's like, what's best. Like, do we have like a strategy folder? Or the content store, that kind of stuff. We'll figure that out in the next few weeks. Um, but just know that like, I'm creating something that's entirely to just do this pretty much. Like,

william: okay.

alexander: Yeah. As an open source project that's, it's not payable. No.

william: Okay. Got it. Okay. Cool. Okay. Sounds good. So, so I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll think about this. Um, and then I can have different, I can basically have different, let's say, of these LM guidelines for different workflows, right? Because sometimes, for example, you want to be a brand, like I wanted to be a brand strategist. Let's see when it gets to the content marketing, not the content marketing, that the market research part. Maybe it's really, maybe a brand strategist, that could be one part. Because I also want to have part of that to be like, how do you win in the market? Right? Here's, here's what the market, here's, here's the top three top four competitors. Here's what they do. Where are the vulnerabilities that our brand can win in the market? Or like, you know, take advantage, right? Or exploit, right? In terms of the messaging, whatever. Right? So there's a brand strategist part to that, but also maybe the higher tier or, or, or part of those instructions is just researcher, right? You're an expert -tier market researcher and stuff. I'm sure that's going to shift, right? The way that it approaches the content. Maybe even a little

alexander: bit. I, I, I agree. I agree. I agree. I mean, we are getting a little bit into optimization territory, which I don't mind doing early on, especially because you want to get an understanding of, of how this kind of works. And just to give you an idea of like, a template that I use as a guideline that, honestly, he, it kind of turns Claude into a dick, but fuck man. Like, it's actually significantly,

william: it's significantly better

alexander: in terms of how it performs. It's a bit annoying. I fixed it a few times because, uh, for that, for example, are you, are you looking at it now? You're reading it now. It says for each response, start with the hard truth. I need to hear. Are you, are you, are you sharing something? Uh, yeah. I sent it on Slack. It's like, for each response, start with the hard truth. I need to hear it's annoying because sometimes it's just like, Hey, my name is Alex. It's like, okay, here's the hard truth. Alex is a shit name. And it's just like, oh, fuck dude. You know what I mean? So like,

william: it's something kind of like irrelevant to like, yeah, it's such a big

alexander: thing to be a dick. But when

william: you

alexander: say you have an IQ 180, you're brutally honest and direct, like you've built, you've built companies, all that kind of stuff. You have direct expertise, X, Y, Z, like this honestly, just this, the system prompt improves the output 10X.

william: Jen, it's very, very

alexander: impressive.

william: Actually, this is, this is exactly like very similar, like, like this is exactly what about. Yeah, exactly. So you're, you're, you're doing this in terms of, before we even approach it to define the personality and the level of thinking of the actual element,

alexander: dude, I have the exact same problem as you because yeah, it should agree with everything you say. And it's like, when you have like an actual like life choice you make, like when I was quitting my job, I was like, oh, I'd love to quit my job to start my own company or whatever. And the AI model is like, yeah, fuck yeah, dude. Like quit your job. Great. I put this prompt in, I made this prompt. And then all of a sudden it was like, dude, you really need to consider things. And it made me consider options. I just never considered because it pushed back, which is what you did. It was, as you said, it was skeptical. Now, the downside was like, I had like one of my, my female friends who was going through a breakup and she was using chat to me as like a, like a sounding board and they agreed with everything it said. Then when I, I put, I gave her this prompt, it just was like, it was like, I think you're, you're, you're, you're at fault. And I was like, okay, there's

william: ways to approach

alexander: this. Right. But already this as a cursor guideline, you're going to get significantly better output.

william: Okay. Okay. Okay. That's good. Yeah. Okay. So it's okay. So that, that, that's good. So like, like, like I'm thinking, okay, so first step define that, that the LLM or the, the, the, the scope in which you want to be operating the wavelength of all these LLMs. Right. So define that in whatever way. Second is like scrape. So for example, going back to this, right. Going back to the thing and I'll do this on my own time in terms of developing this, because I want to spend some time really thinking about that. I think even your example, I'll, I'll, I'll probably steal a few things from yours. So yours looks very interesting. And then, um, uh, so the first step is for, for this to get context, right? So that's scraping, let's say as simple as, as scraping the website. Yeah. Right. So you scrape the website. If I go here, I'm making a new session here. And then what do I do? Is it fire crawl? Like, like, like how, like, how do I do that?

alexander: So let's, let's think of prompts, right? Because again, it has access to the tools now, which means that within every kind of prompt you give it, or we request, it's going to be able to see which tools are at disposal. So if you want

william: to

alexander: fire crawl, you just explicitly tell it. So I would say something like, you know, we're creating this. Let's just do like at brand fundamentals template. So you give it an understanding. Cool. Right. So I would say like, we are creating, uh, we're performing the research to create this template file in line. No, we're performing the research in order to create the brand fundamentals file in line of the template.

william: So they were performing. The research or like to do, can I just, okay. We're performing the research to, to provide the information for, do I just like do this again? No, I

alexander: would just say like brand fundamentals file. It'll understand that you're trying to make a brand fundamentals file basically for a brand fundamentals file or

william: for the, can you say like, like brand fundamentals, um, like needing to perform this document based on this file for a convey dot cloud. Would that work as a prompt?

alexander: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, actually what you want to do is you want to quite paste the HTTPS, uh, link because it's going to be able to kind of research it. Um, and you should just quite paste that. And it'll be like, and then I would say you have access to perplexity and the fire crawl to scrape and develop a deep understanding of the company. Right.

william: Okay. So, so it, but this, do I need to add anything to this?

alexander: Yeah. I would just say you have access to perplexity and fire crawl. Use these tools to, you know, X, Y, Z.

william: But, but, but I thought it already by default knows that.

alexander: It does. It does. But without like either changing the LLM guidelines so that it has like, it knows when to use it. Cause right now it just has access to the description. But if you, if it knows that like you want to scrape the website, when you mentioned a website, that kind of stuff, I believe it's all stuff we're going to implement down the line, but for now we're going to just be a little bit more verbose about it. Um, especially when I build out that framework as well, like all this is going to go away, which is going to be great. And it'll be, it'll be fun, but we'll see how it goes. I have access to perplexity of fire crawl to, uh, scrape the website, understand it's, uh, ICP and USP. Um, can

william: I just take the full

alexander: context? Yeah. Yeah. Just try that actually.

william: Yeah. Let's be super big about it and just search. And then, and then does it matter at this point, which LLM it is? Like does one LLM perform better for this activity?

alexander: Yeah. A Claude, Claude Forsyne. I don't know what they're smoking out at Arthropic, but for some reason, their models are just significantly better than other models. Okay. Even if they don't reason as well, they don't, they're not like charting all the tops. They just are better. They perform consistently better. So,

william: so my question before I press enter here, um, will I like once, like for each workflow for this, right? Since this, a lot of this could be, let's say like, again, with that blueprint I have, right? Right. There's a lot of repeatable process. There's a lot of repeatable steps in terms of a process, right? Yeah. Could I, could I start as I do this, could I, let's say, I wouldn't say automate this, but more like whether it's a keyword perform this, right? And then, and then all of a sudden it's doing this, what I'm doing manually, it does it automatically.

alexander: Yeah. So that's exactly what the framework I'm building is trying to do. It's what it's going to do is going to basically allow you to create a workflow file. Right. So you, if you have like finally great prompts at work, for example, and you have an idea of how you want to kind of break down the steps, or if not, it'll just define it yourself. And you give it an objective or a template, it'll break it down to steps pretty much with really good prompts. And then all you're going to do is just be like, okay, let's go through this workflow. And it's going to start working through it with you. And then ask you kind of questions throughout the entire process and be like, Hey, are you happy with this output? Like whatever, whatever, you can kind of guide it. And then the end goal is to get the strategy document. And just at the end of it, you have the strategy document and use all the relevant tools that you gave it to its disposal. So it's, it's, um, it'll, it'll, it'll simplify a lot of this shit for us. And I

william: reckon

alexander: I'll get the first version done by tomorrow. I've been working on it for the last week. So I'm quite excited.

william: Okay. All right. Sounds good. Okay. So when I hit send here.

alexander: Yeah. So I mean, conceptually what we're doing here, we're trying to one shot the entire template. Like, and I reckon it'll do some good work, but like the idea is like the heavy lifting for us comes in and like break it. Yeah. So there you go. Except to run the tool. The heavy lifting for us comes at like actually thinking through and designing a great workflow, right. And giving it like a really good objective. Um, and giving it like the input it needs throughout the entire process. And you'll, you'll tend to ask this output, especially to combine it with the cursor rules as well.

william: I said, I, I, I suppose to that, um, by like the feedback that, that, that, that we give it is something that we can also log. So that almost kind of kind of negative keywords work almost like this is like, do not do X, Y, and Z, you know, would that be part of it?

alexander: Yeah. You add that to cursor rules. You just be

william: like, this,

alexander: this is like, please avoid creating markdown files unless it's in line with the file structure that we define all that kind of stuff. Please avoid overkill on all the tools, whatever it might be. I also, what I like to do is I like to press on the thought for three seconds. We just press that. Uh, I would take this, the, where it says thought for three seconds or a thought for two. Yeah. That it kind of

william: like,

alexander: it shows you it's thinking process.

william: Yeah. Yeah. I like that too.

alexander: I like to analyze it. Just be

william: like, yeah.

alexander: You know, what are you thinking buddy? Yeah. Yeah. Perplexity to take a while, a while longer than, so I want to, yeah, you can skip it if you want. Fair enough. Uh, file cross search. Nice.

william: So, so is there a way where, you know, like, do you, are you, are you, are you ever in a situation where you don't want to run the tool? Like it's asked me to run the tools and I'm, I'm pressing run tool, which I imagine. I mean, what, like it, like I imagine 95%, if not 99%, maybe a hundred percent, you always want to run the tool if it's asking you to run the tool. Are you, are you in a situation where it's like, no, I want you to run the tool and you decline it?

alexander: Yeah. Sometimes it just, it takes the piss and it just runs like 20 tools. And it's just like, dude, for fuck's sake, I asked you like, what's the ICP of the customer? Like,

william: okay. Like you,

alexander: you don't need to run 30 fucking tools to do that. But that comes down to bad cursor rules. It comes down to a bad prompt. Right. Like

william: I,

alexander: this is kind of the point I was trying to make before. And I've, I've seen this happen over and over again, which is why I'm like really happy to do like the kind of cursor approach more. We tend to jump way too quickly towards massive complexity. Like when we think about improving the model, like improving this, we always think about like fine tuning this crazy model, creating this huge data set. Like this is really going to be an activity for you to understand that guidelines and good prompting and kind of like good kind of guard rails will get you very, very, very far. And then the rest is just an optimization problem,

william: which

alexander: is always simplest.

william: Okay. Yeah. So here, it says here, Brandon and Judd. Okay, so so this is something here, where that's

alexander: the analysis markdown file, by the way. That's not the output.

william: Okay. Oh, this is something else. This is that. Okay. I can do that. I can just accept that stuff. Yeah. Okay, actually, let's compare this. So this gave me this. But shouldn't this have given me more?

alexander: Yeah, so it's in that file on the left there. So that's the file that I created for you. It just wrote all the output straight into that content into that file. So that's, that's the template file. That's kind of like recreated all the information you asked for it. So that's the template. And then if you go to a cavebrandfundamentals .md on the left, it created a file for you. And so it's asking you, do you want to accept or reject this file? Because and you just say accept for now, right? Because then what you do off the back of it, let's say you accept it, you read the file, you don't like it, you ask it to make some changes, it's going to ask you to accept or reject the changes. And it's going to like highlight it in red, if it's deleting it and green, if it's adding to the file. So it's kind of like making changes pretty much. So if you accept that, it's now accepted the file, and you have the output of your research as a as a markdown file.

william: Okay, here, here is, I actually reviewed it so far, it looks good, to be honest. Okay, so, and again, I don't know if we want to get to optimization territory or not. I don't know, maybe it's just how I'm thinking about this. Let me know if this is like needed now, or maybe we do this later on, is there's a few things. One is, and maybe this also comes in like that a little guidelines .mdc part is, I actually saw, I want to send it to you. I have to, I saw something on Instagram, where someone made these really good prompts for each LLM to not hallucinate. Right? Maybe you saw it floating around, I think it maybe went viral or something, I'll send it over to you. The point I'm trying to make is that, should we have that as part of, let's say, the guidelines? And the reason why I'm saying that is that, especially when you get technical, especially, economy is not that bad. It gets, it gets worse when it comes to Web3 stuff. And what I mean by that is that, when I work with like, very heavy infrastructure -based clients for Web3, sometimes, like, you can get a lot of hallucinations. Right? That sounds like it's real. Right? And that's when I started to have like, trust issues with LLMs. Because Web3, all these crypto projects and crypto infrastructure projects, blockchain projects, sometimes there's a lot of information, sometimes there isn't. Right? And depending on, let's say, the other brand and how much content they put out to really keep, you know, like everyone, their community, even like, you know, enthusiasts, abreast on what, like, what's actually happening, their technology updates, all the fine details. Some do a good job on that, some don't. If I'm working with, let's say, a partnership, where one, let's say, I'm working with a client that is doing some cool marketing partnership, but I need to understand the context of the other parties, you know, infrastructure, to understand, okay, what is the integration here? What's, what, how can I develop a narrative, where I can create, you know, there's infrastructure partnerships, but how do you create, like, a story around that, where some people understand and get? Sometimes, I'm in a situation where, like, the LLM, when doing the research of the counterparty, is hallucinating, because there's not a lot of information in there. Yeah. And then I'm under the impression, and I got, I've been in situations where, like, I realized, holy shit, there's actually nothing on this. It can't source it. And then when I go back to the LLM saying, like, where are you getting this information? It eventually admits, is that, like, these aren't accurate. Right? So, the question is this. Do we, from the get -go, like, looking at this, right, should we always have a part where there's sources for each section? For example, like, okay, top three pain points, maybe this is, that's more of, like, you know, but, like, things like, like, how is it getting this information? I know it's, like, it's trained with all this information, right? But is there a way where we can source things that can be sourced? That, that can't be sourced. That, like, that, that, that can be sourced.

alexander: Yeah.

william: So, you remember

alexander: last week, when, when we were, when we were, like, uh, how did you get that information? Or not last week, on Tuesday, when it, it found

william: a

alexander: competitor that you weren't aware about, and you're like, how did you get that information? And then it, oh,

william: yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway,

alexander: it

william: was, and it was on the blog

alexander: post. Yeah. Yeah. So, when you're using the NLM, right, as I mentioned before, if you're just using Claude or Chatry -T, it's going to hallucinate, because it's using, um, essentially, just as memory, or it's, it's, it's, it's AI weightings, uh, which is just memory at that point, right? And what you do, and what we're doing to get around that, and you can, it's a, it's a tool problem, a prompt problem, and a guideline problem, right? So, you combine all three of those together to kind of get this output. You give it guidelines to say, you know, when you, when you work on strategy called documentation, always give citations, right? As part of the guidelines, you also say, if you're doing any research or something, always use perplexity and fire crawl. That's how you get around the, the hallucination stuff, by the way, because fire crawl is scraping a website, so it has to have, be from the source of that website. There's no other choice. And uh, information, right? So there's always a citation included in perplexity. So by saying, always use perplexity for market research stuff, or always use fire crawl to scrape stuff on the website, it won't, it won't only just give you the citation, it'll tell you exactly where it got the information from, from within a real blog post, or from within the real website that it's scraping it from. But if you rely on just Claude, on Chad or T, you're going to get, you're going to get hallucinations. So that's why we kind of force it to use perplexity. And that's why I kind of force it to use fire crawl.

william: So, so are you saying that by default, if we're using fire crawl and perplexity, we don't have to worry about hallucinations at all? Or, or at least worry about really defining about

alexander: sources? We need to be explicit with the model that any information comes from the sources that are being pulled in through our third party tools. Got

william: it. Okay.

alexander: And even better is if you ask it to output in every subset, the citations or something like that, right? Because it's not going to hallucinate the output of the citation, right? And it needs to be able to think about that.

william: So is that, is that, is that part of the workflow that happens in the LLM guidelines part? Or is that part of the workflow that happens when you actually prompt these, these kinds of phases of brand fundamentals? Like for example, this one here.

alexander: Yeah. I mean, I would kind of do both to really make sure, right? Like we can try just for the LLM guidelines. You could try, like when after this call, try that exact same prompt again, literally the exact same prompt, but then just change the LLM guidelines to say every output you use needs to have citations involved in it and then see if it, if it catches on, you know, and see if it works because it could just kind of get lost a little bit in the context of everything, right? But if you're explicit in the prompt, it 100 % will be in the prompt. It will be

william: in

alexander: the output. Yeah.

william: Okay. So that's one thing that I'll know that's almost like homework for me to like kind of mess around with that.

alexander: Yeah.

william: As part of it, the other part is what I've done for certain things like this, especially because I think foundational work is like, the better the foundational work, the better your life will be just in general. Sure. That's what the problem is that there's in life, right? But for this, I like to, like for example, 03 is slow, but I find it very good. I actually find, I've also been playing around recently, well, the last few weeks for certain things. Have you, have you used Opus? Yeah. Yeah. Opus is actually, it's actually quite, it's probably the most creative LLM. So I know, but Opus is expensive. I think 03, they dropped their token price to compete with Gemini 2 .5. I think I read something like that. I think Gemini 2 .5 is all around, like, I think Gemini, I think Gemini 2 .5 is my favorite, right? I, I, it's, it's very, yeah, it's, it's very good. Um, when it comes down to writing and stuff, then I start to lean through Claude stuff. Why I'm saying this, this is, this is a reason. What I've done in the past, and sometimes it's been overkill and sometimes it's just a grind, right? But sometimes I do get better. Um, if I go through it, I end up getting a really good doc, is I run through this, what we just did right now, we did this for Claude 4. I would run it maybe to 03, right? Or maybe, uh, Gemini 2 .5 or so, right? It's going to give you different outputs. There's going to be a lot of overlap, but one LLM sometimes sees things better or, or, or, or, or even like produces better results for certain aspects than other LLMs, right? Um, do you think this should be part of the workflow? Not, not for everything, but maybe at least for the foundational stuff, since it's so important.

alexander: What, what should part of the workflow, the idea of deciding which models to use for a specific step of the workflow?

william: Like, like, for example, the, the, this right here, we use Claude 4. Yeah. If we ran this now, and this file, Akavi brand fundamentals, let's call this fundamentals underscore Claude 4. We run the same thing on the Gemini 2 .5 bottle and another one on 03, right? It produces three different files. And then it prompts like now, now, uh, review all three of these files that, that had a different LLM output and create the, like a holistic, the best out of everything. Sure.

alexander: Sure. You could definitely do that. Like you could ask it to output Akavi brand fundamentals, underscore 03, underscore sonnet, underscore Gemini. And then you can do like a compilation phase where it kind of structures all of it into one. And I would just break that down to a workflow, uh, a workflow file. Um,

william: and then, and then maybe use the same, even for that, that, that, that, that, use the best model for that, you know, to, to, to, to, to analyze all three, uh, all three files, right. But that's Opus, which I don't think you have, I don't think Chris allows Opus in this you get max. Um, open it up. Let's see. This is max only.

alexander: Uh, this might be very expensive. Uh, you have to turn on max mode. Yeah. What's, what's max mode? I think it's like, it triggers like API usage calls, like straight. It pays the market price of the API usage. If that makes sense. It's basically,

william: I have, I have max. I just have to like, it's from the top.

alexander: Yeah. But I would not turn that on. Cause you're going to wipe out your credits, like within like two days, you'll, you'll, you'll use a month worth of stuff in the two days. Almost certainly. Okay. Yeah. Um, but you could try it, but go by all means.

william: I mean, O3, I find, I, I mean, O3 is still very good. I, I, I really like O3. It's just slower and this and that, but okay. So how do we, okay, let me ask you this. Do, do you think that's, that, that, that is a good approach or you think that's overkill or what I'm saying? I have three different LLMs, analyze three different documents. Then you have an LLM, maybe the smartest LLM that we have access to, to analyze all documents and creating a master document. And that's the document for grant fundamentals, at least to a point before it goes human loop. Yeah. And then, and then it's, it's trying to do it.

alexander: I don't think it's, I don't think it's overkill. And I, and I think what you're recognizing now is that the power comes in. Like if you have a proper file structure in place and you have the proper cursor rules in place, and you've thought through the prompts, the power now shifts away from like how good you are at Googling and like finding the right sources and now shifts to like how creative can you get and thinking through the best workflows and like giving it the right tools and thinking through the best process.

william: Which is really, really why we're here, right? Because like, I, I like all, all the stuff I'm doing right now, like I'm doing with LLMs, this is like a year, year and a half of just me fucking grinding at LLMs, understanding it, right? Right. But like, I mean, like I'm getting to a point where like LL, like I'm doing a lot more than before. Right. And, and it's more like, I, I haven't realized how much, like you kind of real, at least let me see is like, okay, obviously I realized how productive I am versus, you know, pre AIB, this pre chat GPT. Right. And now it's like boiling a frog. You kind of like slowly realize, like, like, you don't realize how much output you're doing. It's just not normal if you're day to day. Right. And then, and then I'm like, okay, but like now it's more about like, it's, I'm spending still the same amount of time on a computer, if not more than before. And I thought, and I thought this was supposed to make me, you know, make, make, make everything all easier. Right. It's just 10, maybe 15, 20, whatever times my output. But then I'm realizing now, and I was, this is why like, you know, even before, like I was telling Crystal is even before, you know, like Crystal connected me with you and stuff. And I think that's why Crystal wanted us to talk and stuff is because it's like, it's like, I'm spending now probably hours on the actual manual. It's still AI, but I'm manually doing all this stuff. Right. Like I just told you, all that stuff would be even like reviewing it, copy and paste it, new document, saving it, putting it, putting it now, waiting for everything to come in now, putting each document, prompting it, all that stuff. Right. That could easily be an hour, you know, easily, you know, so if I, if I can remove that hour, but get the same output, that's the point.

alexander: Yeah.

william: That's, that's kind of my goal.

alexander: Absolutely. And like, fuck that firstly, because I've, I've had the exact same problem. I'm kind of from a programming perspective, but like now that I've been doing marketing stuff for the last few months, I realized like, holy shit, like the tool set that we have available to marketers today is just shit compared to what the programmers have. Right. Like programmers have genuinely got 10x advantages in terms of like from, from AI. Right. Like, okay, fine. We can't like, we can actually even like one shot crazy projects now. And there really isn't that kind of tooling that's available to marketers today. And if there is like, it's like the latest next fucking platform that costs 50 bucks a month, and you have to do all your stuff in a platform, and you know, all your files are in some cloud somewhere and some shit, it's really annoying. And I think the cursor approach, if done intelligently, with like the right structure, deals with a lot of the problems that you have. And you

william: kind of

alexander: have completely full ownership over it. And you could try this like creative stuff, right. And kind of build it out. Like, yeah, if you want to try that workflow, fucking go ahead, try the workflow, like, just make sure that some sort of guidelines are in place. So you give it the right prompt to give it the right rules, structure it away. So you reuse the same workflow structure away. So you reuse the same prompts, have all of it written, just straight and marked down into your computer. So you don't even move files anywhere, all that kind of stuff, like you could really get super, super far of this. And like, I think we're completely aligned with what the pain point is here. And what the what the benefit is to have, like, work, if done once should never be done again. Right? Without a doubt, it should be super findable. It should be clear where it goes. If you really spent like a day creating this beautiful workflow with the best prompts, that workflow, you're going to use it for the rest of your life for the exact same task. Right? It can be repeatable. That's what we're trying to do here. Right?

william: So

alexander: I think together, as you mentioned, you broke it down really nicely into three different steps. You have the branding steps, like the brand guidelines, the strategy, then you have the kind of content generation step, and then you have the optimization step. I do genuinely believe it can all be done with the cursor. And like, that will simplify your life. There's a few things you got to wrap your head around. But I think you honestly, there isn't any concepts, new like other concepts introduced. It's just a way of you and I intelligently thinking through workflows. And be like, Okay, how do we want to break this down? And I kind of create like the tooling around it a little bit.

william: Yeah, and actually see it in action, like, like, build the actual build it. So, okay, I got to hop, I'm sure you got to hop as well. Okay, so I'm going to wait, I'm going to be willing this weekend, but I do plan on spending maybe like an hour or two on the computer. So at least tomorrow, and then the weekend or so, I got, I got a few hours on the bus. Sure. So, like, I'll use that time, at least half of that time, like relatively productively, at least thinking from my phone, doing some stuff, working. For our next session, what should I do? If we have, are you good for Monday, for our next session? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What would make the most impact? So like, okay, the homework I have, I just shot down just based on our conversations, right, is like, okay, what would that LLM guideline look like? Right? Yeah, that's, that's one thing that that's one thing I can do. Should I sketch out whether it's on a, I'm probably doing a document from my phone, or I can, on a mirror board, whatever, maybe map out the workflow. Like, for example, like what we talked about in terms of the approach of doing, and again, that approach, I don't do it for everything. That's something I do for maybe very, very important materials. I don't do it because it's also time consuming. It's also just a crime, you know, it's like tedious in a way, right? Should I just like, think about, like, you tell me what, like, what would be the most impactful to kind of get this up and running? And I'm also like, a lot more prepared for these calls, maybe even have stuff already done, you know, so that we can kind of stream through it. What would your recommendation be?

alexander: I think we should have the next call, we should do an end -to -end workflow together. And I think that kind of consists of us going into the workflow being paired. And so if you're able to kind of like, let's say like the objective for the next call is we come out with like a really good brand fundamentals document that you're actually genuinely happy with, those citations, it's in line with the kind of like way that you want it to be generated, something you would genuinely use, right? That would be a good thing to shoot for, because it means that we're already in the right one, like output, and it's working, then we're really happy. And what that kind of would look like is the LLM guidelines that you're happy with, and kind of communicates with you in the way that you resonate with, and it pushes back, I can also help you out with that as well, like just because it's your homework, like we can still be async through Slack, you can just hit me up be like, hey, like, this is a good thing, try it out, whatever it might be. And then I think if you look at the analysis .md file there, which is a workflow file, think about the steps, because again, what we just did was we just one -shotted the brand guideline file right there, right? Which it'll get you there faster, but I think you're losing out a shit ton on a lot more information you can get, like how is this analysis .md file structured in a way that it really guides the model, like it's getting it the right context, it's asking the right questions at the right time across these different steps, and then it delivers the end goal of the entire kind of workflow, right? So it starts off with like a context generating, so foundational research, right? Then it goes into like digital present audience audit, it looks at the contents already out there, then it moves to the next one, like this is the kind of workflows that you want to have, kind of scattered across your directory, so that you're able to reuse them over and over again, and like the prompts were thought through, you know, like there's a reason why they're structured that way, there's a reason why we're told to look at online reviews and reputation management, because we just know as a marketer there's value in looking at that kind of stuff, and it gives you an idea of what's wrestling with the audience, like what's this current like kind of status, this is where really the marketing skill comes in, and I don't have that you would to get really creative about structuring the workflow. I

william: think

alexander: you've already, you've already understood that, that's where like the skill, the leverage really comes in now from the marketing perspective, is being able to create these really correct prompts, really good workflows, and understand the kind of like output that's needed, these different steps,

william: you know? Okay, yeah, yeah, no, I agree. I'll look at this, see how we can add to this workflow, or at least introduce a lot of these things to the workflow, and you see some really good stuff here. That's actually not even part of my workflow that I think could also be of very good value, so that's really good. Yeah, just actually,

alexander: yeah, just think of your workflow. And then just see how you can put it into like, put it like literally just create an SOP document, which is a bit like this, the marketing document, sorry, a markdown document, and you're good to go.

william: Yeah, the, these, the last question before I hop, just want to understand the full thing, these workflows get triggered. How do they get triggered? Is it, is this with NAN, or is this just with different prompts that trigger different, let's say, files that have prompts? Like, like, how does this all get triggered?

alexander: Well, at the moment, the way that I do it is I literally copy paste where it says prompt to use, I just put it into the cursor agent next to me. And it kind of guides me, I'm looking at the workflow, I copy paste the prompt, put it in the cursor agent. So in the cursor agent, I would say, use perplexed MC to research, yada, yada, yada. I would make sure that I'm happy with the output aligned with the actual workflow step. And then I move to the next one. That's how I do in the moment. But that's what I'm trying to kind of fix the next in this with this framework. So it's kind of automatic a little bit.

william: Okay, so last question on that. So the one thing that and this is just more, this is, I think a lot of I actually kind of find I just realized, I think a lot of the pain points are purely usability, right? A lot of them, but a lot of them are like, like UX usability, right? Another example of it is, when I go to, let's say a session, and I'm doing the prompts, I'm being the information stuff, I look at it, and then I'm like, vibe editing, right? Like enough, sometimes I like, I'll rewrite it myself. Sometimes I was just copy and paste, be like, I need this to be X, Y, and Z better, or X, Y, and Z, or this tone is not the right direction, needs to be X, Y, and Z, focus on this direction, or focus on this message, whatever it is, right? But copy and pasting it, pasting it to my browser, and then, and then writing that stuff, right? Sometimes I would focus on certain aspects, copy and paste, focus it, focus on whatever, and then go to the next, let's say, section, and then do the same thing, right? What would be cool, and I don't know if Cursor has its ability or not, like, for example, this, this file right here, to actually, like, you know how in a Google Doc, you can comment on, like, someone says your document, you got feedback, you can comment on, et cetera, right? Can I comment on one go, the full document, kind of like someone proofreading it, but as they're proofreading it, you know how, like, you got like, you know, let's say your professor, and they'll like, you know, mark something, and then write a comment on the side, right? On your essay, whatever, kind of like that, but like one go, and then, and then you, you provide it, and then it basically takes all those comments, and then it gives you another, another proof, versus sectioning it off, copy and pasting it, doing it, it's a paragraph, or like section by section, you get what I'm

alexander: saying? I think I'm a bit confused, is this to update the workflow file, or is it to actually trigger the workflow file?

william: No, this is, this is to give, give, to give feedback, to, to, to the actual output.

alexander: Gotcha, gotcha. I mean, at the moment, the way you do it is, is through the chat, so once it generates the Kavi brand fundamentals, you would just talk to the chat, be like, this is really bad for XYZ, and then press enter, and then it's going to update the file in front of you, and show you what's changing the file when it hasn't changed,

william: kind of. So like, there's nothing where like, for example, if, if, if, if this is the output file, right, and let's say, for example, no, no, sorry, this was, let's say this, right, this was it. If I, was this it?

alexander: No, it's a template.

william: No, this is it, yeah. So let's say, for example, let's say, let's say like, I, I don't agree with this, I want to have, let's say a comment. Can I, can, can I right click on this? Say, I don't know, maybe there is a comment, or like needs these revisions, and do it for each one, or whatever, I think needs, you know, a better direction. And then, and then re, re input the file, where, where they only change what I commented on, and keep everything else to seem that I don't comment on.

alexander: Yeah, let's try it. I think you can. So if you just press plus on the, uh, actually, I would keep it within the context of this, actually, because now it has the context, it understands what, what you just did, it has all the research. So, uh, highlight it, and then copy paste. Okay,

william: so I'm highlighting this.

alexander: And

william: then

alexander: just do command L. So that would actually just like copy paste it within the context, right, that specific line, so you can talk about it, and it'll like limit the change to that line. Or if you do command K, when you highlight it again.

william: Oh,

alexander: I

william: have to highlight this again?

alexander: Yeah, highlight it again, I'll just try, and just do command K.

william: Yeah, press, you press something else.

alexander: Yeah, so there we go. Edit selected code. So you talk about it now, and it'll edit the selection. So say something like, what do you not like about it?

william: Okay, so let's say, okay, use,

alexander: so command K.

william: Yeah, I'm just trying to think if there's another something I can actually, um, okay, actually here, maybe, maybe something like this. Okay, so I go command K.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Um, don't use the word central, decentralization. Use a word that describes the benefit of what decentralization offers. So like, then press enter. Interpreters data ownership. Okay. So then, okay, so that's, that's how you would do it. Yeah. So you can, so you can edit things. And this is using what, what, what LLM is this using? Is it using the same LLM?

alexander: It's using the auto one. So if you just click, click on where it's using LLM, you can kind of control it as well. So you turn that off and you can choose.

william: Okay. You can add models here. Okay. Oh, interesting. So is this what you do? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

alexander: But if I'm doing a general thing, like don't use the word decentralization, I would use it in the chat because then it'll just do it across the entire file. But if I just need to upload, like update, like a single line, like you're doing here, then I just do a command K.

william: I see. Interesting. Okay. That's a, that's a much cleaner approach than always prompting. And it's always like, you know, updating and it's like, you have to scroll so much. And that, you know, it's like,

alexander: it's a much cleaner approach. You have it like your markdown files there to be edited at all times. Yeah. The, the, some of the crazy shit I was doing, which I was getting really excited by, like this tweet, uh, analyzer thing that I did, I think I showed it to you before with the idea of like the, that metric and stuff, I

william: would do

alexander: the EDS score. Like I would have a content pillar that I would like highlight and I'll be like using my EVS score tool, pull in the relevant tweets to this content pillar and then update it. And then like, it would look at the real tweets that are really resonated with people. And then, and then aren't resonating with people. And I kind of update that content pillar off the back of like real analysis. It was, it was like fucking sick. It was really, it really was like a what the fuck moment where I was like, Oh shit. Like that was really powerful. Yeah.

william: Yeah. Okay. I have a few other questions, but at least over the end of the meeting, it's, uh, uh, yeah. Anyways. Okay. So work on the, uh, on that kind of personality file, start to map out maybe some of like, even these approaches, like, well, the next, the next meeting will start to actually do this. Like in terms of like actually go through it, but, but the cave, but I'll also like in the, in the process so that I, I remember, okay, this is how I'd approach it. Like, this is how I would do it. Right. Like even with maybe certain prompts yourself.

alexander: Yeah.

william: Right. Yeah. Okay. Is there anything else that I need to do?

alexander: No, I think, I think we'll just, let's, let's shoot for the end of the next session on Monday, brand guidelines done, uh, or brand fundamentals done. We've created like a really good workflow that we're happy with. And you kind of are like, fuck, this is good.

william: Okay. And then, and then, yeah. And then the next session and what we do, let's say that the competitor, well, does that include the competitor analysis? Brand fundamentals does include positioning. No, competitor, then there's, yeah, competitor and market analysis. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I have to see if, if, if some of the, the, the competitor and market analysis should go to brand fundamentals as building blocks. But maybe not. They have like trend scan through competitors. Yeah. Because for example, competitor analysis, market analysis, I've seen so many from different brands, startups, you know, like even like mature brands and stuff. They, they, there's obviously a lot of overlap, but their formats are very different. Right. I find, right. Like it really depends. So coming up with, let's say a really good format of like, this is like the de facto way of creating competitor analysis, without making it so crazy long as well. Right. Yeah. There's like a middle ground.

alexander: Yeah.

william: I

alexander: mean, we need to be kind of pay native of this, right? Like you have to be like, or else the scope is just going to be unlimited, but if you're opinionated about what you want in it, then it simplifies your life, uh, uh, crap done.
