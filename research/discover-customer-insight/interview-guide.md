# Customer Discovery Interview Guide

## Purpose

Validate positioning hypotheses and uncover deep psychological drivers behind customer decisions. This is **not a satisfaction survey** - it's strategic research to understand:
- Identity transformation (who they were → who they are)
- Decision criteria (what really mattered)
- Emotional drivers (not just rational features)
- Customer language (their exact words)

---

## Interview Principles

### DO:
- ✅ **Ask "why" 3-5 times** to go deeper - don't accept surface answers
- ✅ **Capture EXACT words** - quotes matter for language mapping
- ✅ **Listen for emotion** - "frustrated," "anxious," "excited" reveal truth
- ✅ **Let silence happen** - don't fill pauses, let them think
- ✅ **Follow interesting threads** - don't rigidly stick to script
- ✅ **Probe contradictions** - if they say X but did Y, explore why

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Feed them your language** - Don't ask "Would you say you're a Marketing Architect?"
- ❌ **Ask leading questions** - Don't ask "Don't you think ownership is important?"
- ❌ **Rush to next question** - Probe deeper on interesting answers
- ❌ **Defend or explain** - You're learning, not selling
- ❌ **Interview for too long** - 30-45 minutes max, respect their time

## SECTION 1: The "Before" State
**Goal:** Understand the pain in *their* words (not ours)

### Question 1A: Workflow Deep-Dive
> "Before you found [Alavida/vibeflow], describe a typical week working on client strategy or content. Walk me through what that looked like - the tools, the process, the time spent."

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Gets them to SHOW the pain, not just tell it
- Captures their actual workflow language
- Reveals what they thought was "normal"

**What to listen for:**
- Time spent (hours/days/weeks)
- Emotional language ("frustrating," "overwhelming," "tedious")
- Tool-switching patterns ("copy-pasting between...")
- Manual workarounds ("I would have to...")

**Probing questions:**
- "Walk me through a specific example - maybe the last project before you found us?"
- "What part of that process frustrated you most?"
- "How did you feel at the end of those weeks?"

---

### Question 1B: Emotional Trigger
> "What was the **emotional state** you were in when you started looking for a solution? What finally made you say 'I need to change something'?"

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Reveals the **trigger moment** (urgency vs. curiosity)
- Captures emotional intensity (mild annoyance vs. crisis)
- Identifies if pain was internal (burnout) or external (competitive threat)

**What to listen for:**
- Crisis language: "frustrated," "overwhelmed," "anxious," "breaking point"
- Competitive fear: "losing edge," "being left behind," "others adapting faster"
- Identity crisis: "I'm becoming a bottleneck," "this isn't sustainable"

**Probing questions:**
- "Was there a specific moment or event that triggered the search?"
- "How long had you been feeling this way before you acted?"
- "What would have happened if you didn't find a solution?"

---

### Question 1C: Language Capture
> "How would you have described the problem to a colleague back then? Like if someone asked 'what's wrong?' - what would you have said?"

**Strategic Purpose:**
- **Captures customer language** in their own words
- Reveals if they even had vocabulary for the problem
- Shows how they frame the pain socially (professional vs. personal)

**What to listen for:**
- Do they say "I need better AI tools" or "I need to work differently"?
- Do they frame it as skill gap, tool gap, or systems gap?
- What exact words and metaphors do they use?

**Probing questions:**
- "Did you use any specific words or phrases repeatedly when thinking about this?"
- "How did you search for solutions? What terms did you Google?"

---

## SECTION 2: Competitive Alternatives
**Goal:** Understand decision criteria and what you're *really* competing against

### Question 2A: Alternatives Considered

---

### Question 2B: Rejection Reasons
> "For each alternative, what made you **not** choose it? What was the dealbreaker?"

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Reveals **anti-personas** - what you're NOT
- Exposes values (if they rejected "easy" tools, they value control)
- Identifies fears (vendor lock-in, cost, learning curve)

**What to listen for:**
- "Too black-box" → values transparency/control
- "Subscription model" → values ownership
- "Too simple/templated" → values sophistication
- "Not customizable" → values control
- "Can't trust the outputs" → needs verification

**Probing questions:**
- "What specifically about [alternative] made you think 'this won't work'?"
- "If they had changed [X], would you have chosen them?"

---

- "I saw [person] do it in real-time" → social proof
- "It aligned with how I already think" → identity match
- "The ROI was obvious" → rational calculation
- "I just trusted [founder/person]" → relationship-driven

**Probing questions:**
- "Was it one big 'aha' moment or gradual realization?"
- "What was the final thing that tipped you over?"
- "How long between that moment and actually starting?"

---

### Question 3B: Peer Explanation

- Identifies what proof points matter (testimonials, demos, founder trust)
- Shows if early adopters are leap-of-faith types or proof-demanders

**What to listen for:**
- **High confidence (8-10):** "I trusted the vision" = philosophical alignment
- **Medium confidence (5-7):** "I was willing to test it" = pragmatic trial
- **Low confidence (1-4):** "I was desperate" = pain-driven

**Probing questions:**
- "What would have increased your confidence?"
- "What proof did you need to see before committing?"

---

## SECTION 4: The Transformation

---

## SECTION 5: The Human-Loop Philosophy
**Goal:** Validate that control/judgment is competitive advantage

### Question 5A: Full Automation Test
> "If I could wave a magic wand and make the entire process fully automated - you just press a button and perfect strategy documents appear - would you want that? Why or why not?"

**Strategic Purpose:**
- Tests **human-loop as feature** hypothesis
- Reveals if they value control intrinsically or just tolerate it
- Identifies if "vibe marketing" philosophy is widespread

**What to listen for:**
- "No, I need to guide it" → values control/judgment
- "Yes, if it's good enough" → values efficiency primarily

- Identifies if loyalty is fragile (feature-based) or durable (philosophical)
- Shows what competitors could do to win them back

**What to listen for:**
- "If setup becomes too complex" → pragmatic churn risk
- "If I lose control/ownership" → philosophical dealbreaker
- "If output quality drops" → performance-based
- "If price increases significantly" → cost-sensitive

- Shows you value their input long-term
- Opens door for case studies/testimonials

---

## Post-Interview: Capture Protocol

**Immediately after the call:**

1. **Transcribe or take detailed notes** while memory is fresh
2. **Flag quotes** - Mark exact language for customer voice
3. **Emotional markers** - Note when they got excited, frustrated, passionate
4. **Contradictions** - Flag if they said X but did Y
5. **Patterns** - Compare to previous interviews, note themes

**Key things to document:**
- ✅ Direct quotes (verbatim language)
- ✅ Emotional tone (frustration, excitement, anxiety)
- ✅ Unprompted insights (what they brought up without being asked)
- ✅ Hesitations/pauses (where they struggled to articulate)
- ✅ Surprising answers (challenged your assumptions)

---

## Analysis Framework

After 3-5 interviews, look for:

**Patterns:**
- Common pain points across customers
- Repeated language/metaphors
- Similar decision journeys
- Shared values/fears

**Outliers:**
- Unique use cases
- Different decision criteria
- Alternative competitive sets
- Unexpected transformations

**Validation:**
- Do positioning hypotheses hold?
- Does "Marketing Architect" resonate?
- Is ownership philosophy widespread?
- Is human-loop valued universally?

**Refinements:**
- What language do THEY use vs. what we assume?
- What matters more/less than we thought?
- What competitive alternatives are we missing?
- What churn risks need addressing?

## Tips for Effective Interviewing

### Building Rapport:
- Start with gratitude: "Thank you for taking the time - your insights will directly shape how we serve customers like you"
- Acknowledge expertise: "You're living this every day, so you're the expert here"
- Create safety: "There are no wrong answers - push back if something doesn't resonate"

### Active Listening:
- **Reflect back:** "So what I'm hearing is..." (confirms understanding)
- **Label emotions:** "It sounds like that was really frustrating" (validates feelings)
- **Pause before next question:** Let silence work (they often fill it with gold)

### Going Deeper:
- **"Tell me more about that"** - Open-ended probe
- **"What do you mean by [word]?"** - Unpack their language
- **"Why?"** x3-5 - Keep digging until you hit bedrock
- **"Can you give me a specific example?"** - Get concrete

### Managing Time:
- Let them know upfront: "I have 10 questions, should take 30-40 minutes"
- If they're verbose: "That's fascinating - I want to make sure we cover everything. Can we bookmark that and come back if we have time?"
- If they're concise: Go deeper with probes rather than rushing through
