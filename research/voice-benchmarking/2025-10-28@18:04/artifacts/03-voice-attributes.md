---

## Brand 1: Anjunadeep

### Core Voice Attributes

**1. Sophisticated Restraint**

[ATTRIBUTE] Anjunadeep uses minimal, carefully chosen language that lets the music and experience speak for themselves.

Evidence:
- Product titles are evocative but sparse: "EURÊKA! by Romain Garcia", "Missing Places I've Never Been"
- Homepage hero is a single sentence: "Anjunadeep is Above & Beyond's deep house imprint."
- Call to action is direct and unadorned: "Send us your demo"

**2. Heritage-Conscious**

[ATTRIBUTE] The voice emphasizes history, evolution, and legacy while maintaining forward momentum.

Evidence:
- "At 17 years old, Anjunadeep has evolved a great deal since its inception, and while the BPMs may have slowed, and the label family exponentially expanded, Anjunadeep remains just as committed to finding and supporting the very best in soulful electronic music."
- Uses temporal markers: "Founded in 2005", "Today, the label is one of dance music's most respected imprints"
- References artist legacy: "introduced the world to artists like Lane 8, Yotto and Dusky"

**3. Community-Centric**

[ATTRIBUTE] Language emphasizes belonging, inclusivity, and shared experience over exclusivity or gatekeeping.

Evidence:
- "The label has become renowned for creating a friendly, welcoming party atmosphere"
- Uses inclusive "we" framing: "Subscribe to our newsletter"
- Emphasis on global community: "fiercely loyal following around the globe", "events in 15 countries across five continents"

**4. Music-as-Language**

[ATTRIBUTE] The brand uses musical and emotional descriptors as primary communication tools.

Evidence:
- Uses third-party press quote as bio: "Anjunadeep is simply soulful, meaningful, emotional...deep." - Clash Magazine
- Genre descriptors are precise: "melodic house, electronic, ambient and techno"
- Emotional titles: "Missing Places I've Never Been", "Feeling Fades"
- Location-based storytelling: "From Sydney With Love", "Live from Galle, Sri Lanka"

**5. Understated Authority**

[ATTRIBUTE] Credibility is established through facts, roster, and third-party validation rather than self-promotion.

Evidence:
- Lets achievements speak: "over 600 releases", "sold out premiere venues including London's Printworks, and New York's Brooklyn Mirage"
- Uses press validation instead of self-description: Clash Magazine quote as profile bio
- Lists impressive roster without commentary: "CamelPhat, DJ Koze, Tale Of Us, Maya Jane Coles, Boris Brejcha..."

---

### Tone Spectrum Positioning

**Formality: Moderately Formal → Casual (60% toward formal)**

Evidence:
- Complete sentences with proper grammar throughout
- Professional vocabulary: "imprint", "showcases", "destination festival"
- But avoids stuffiness: "of course" creates conversational moment in: "all soundtracked, of course, by some of the world's most innovative deep producers and selectors"

**Emotion: Serious → Humorous (90% toward serious)**

Evidence:
- No humor detected in any samples
- Emotional register is earnest and respectful: "soulful electronic music", "fiercely loyal following"
- Titles evoke emotion but don't play with it: "Missing Places I've Never Been" is wistful, not playful

**Authority: Respectful → Irreverent (85% toward respectful)**

Evidence:
- Deferential to artists: emphasizes artist names in bold throughout roster
- Respectful of heritage: "Founded in 2005 by Above & Beyond, and their manager James Grant"
- No challenging or provocative language detected

**Directness: Straightforward → Subtle (55% toward subtle)**

Evidence:
- Facts are direct: "independent record label based in London", "Founded in 2005"
- But evocative rather than explicit about emotional impact: "Missing Places I've Never Been" (not "Nostalgic Melodies")
- Newsletter value prop is straightforward: "10% discount code" (direct benefit)

---

### Writing Principles

**Sentence Structure:**

Pattern: Moderate to long, flowing sentences with subordinate clauses that create rhythm

Examples:
- "Founded in 2005 by Above & Beyond, and their manager James Grant, Anjunadeep began life as an outlet for records from the deeper, more progressive end of Above & Beyond's club sets." (34 words)
- "With over 600 releases spanning melodic house, electronic, ambient and techno, the diversity and integrity of the label's sound has earned Anjunadeep a fiercely loyal following around the globe." (31 words)

Observation: Sentences are complete and grammatically complex, creating a sophisticated reading experience. No sentence fragments detected. The rhythm mimics the flowing, progressive nature of deep house music itself.

**Vocabulary Choices:**

Pattern: Industry-specific terminology balanced with accessible emotional language

Technical terms:
- "imprint", "BPMs", "deep house", "melodic house", "ambient and techno"
- "progressive", "selectors", "producers"

Emotional/accessible terms:
- "soulful", "fiercely loyal", "friendly, welcoming party atmosphere"
- "meaningful, emotional...deep"

Distinctive phrases:
- "the deeper, more progressive end of [their] club sets" (precision descriptor)
- "of course" (creates conversational break in formal sentence)
- "diversity and integrity" (paired abstract values)

**Grammatical Patterns:**

Active voice dominates:
- "Anjunadeep has introduced the world to artists..."
- "The label has released remixes from..."
- "Anjunadeep hosts regular showcases..."

Third person institutional voice:
- Always "Anjunadeep" or "the label", never "we" in formal copy
- Exception: Newsletter uses "our": "Subscribe to our newsletter"

Statements over questions:
- No questions detected in any samples
- Declarative statements establish facts and credibility

Minimal imperatives:
- "Send us your demo" (only direct command observed)
- "Subscribe to our newsletter" (transactional)

---

### Distinctive Voice Elements

**Storytelling Approach:**

Narrative-driven, heritage-focused

- Opening narrative traces origin story: "Founded in 2005... began life as an outlet..."
- Evolution arc: "At 17 years old, Anjunadeep has evolved a great deal since its inception"
- Character-driven through artist roster: doesn't just list names, contextualizes their role ("introduced the world to")

**Humor & Personality:**

No humor detected. Personality expressed through:
- Restraint and sophistication (what's NOT said)
- Passion for music: "fiercely loyal", "soulful", "meaningful, emotional"
- Confidence through understatement: lets facts speak

Emotional connection strategy:
- Belonging to community: "friendly, welcoming party atmosphere"
- Shared musical journey: "Missing Places I've Never Been" creates relatability through universal emotion
- Location-based experiences: "Live from Galle, Sri Lanka" evokes travel and adventure

**Visual Language:**

Minimal metaphors or analogies. Language is literal and precise.

Imagery through:
- Geographic references: "London", "Albania", "Brooklyn Mirage", "Galle, Sri Lanka"
- Physical spaces: "Printworks", "premiere venues", "destination festival"
- Musical/emotional states: "deep", "progressive", "soulful"

Concrete over abstract:
- Concrete: "600 releases", "15 countries", "five continents"
- Abstract (when used): "diversity and integrity", "soulful electronic music"

---

### Channel Adaptations

**Consistency across channels:**
- Sophisticated restraint maintained everywhere (website, social, newsletter)
- No code-switching detected between platforms
- Third-person institutional voice in all formal contexts

**Social Media Adaptation:**
- Twitter/X bio uses third-party press quote instead of self-description
- This is consistent with brand strategy: let others define you (authority through validation)

**Product vs. Editorial Voice:**
- Product titles: ultra-minimal, evocative ("EURÊKA!", "Missing Places I've Never Been")
- Editorial/About: fuller sentences, narrative structure, heritage storytelling
- Both share sophistication and emotional core

**Newsletter/Transactional Copy:**
- Slightly more direct: "Subscribe to our newsletter for all the latest release, events and news"
- Adds value prop: "10% discount code"
- Still maintains professional tone, no marketing hype

---

### Voice Signature

**What makes Anjunadeep's voice unique:**

1. **Emotional precision without sentimentality**: The voice conveys deep feeling ("soulful", "meaningful, emotional") without being saccharine or overwrought.

2. **Heritage as narrative backbone**: Every communication is grounded in history and evolution, positioning the present as continuation of a respected legacy.

3. **Understatement as power move**: The brand's confidence is expressed through what it *doesn't* say—minimal product descriptions, letting music and roster speak.

4. **Music-first language**: Even non-musical content uses musical descriptors and rhythm (flowing sentences, "BPMs may have slowed", genre precision).

5. **Community through subtlety**: Inclusivity is baked into descriptions ("friendly, welcoming") rather than performed through exclamation points or hyperbole.

**Memorable characteristics:**
- Location-based storytelling in titles
- Bold artist names throughout copy
- Press quotes as brand definition
- The phrase "of course" creating a conversational aside in formal text
- Consistent avoidance of marketing language or hype

**What makes Super X's voice unique:**

1. **Radical transparency as brand differentiator**: Sharing revenue, emotional lows, and process publicly creates trust and relatability that corporate brands can't match.

3. **Builder-to-builder peer voice**: Not selling to customers, but sharing tools and lessons with fellow creators on the same journey.

4. **Authentic casual without trying hard**: Uses creator vernacular ("banger", "OP") naturally because that's the actual audience language, not marketing trying to sound cool.

5. **Energy through rhythm**: Sentence fragments create staccato urgency ("Ship faster. Test ideas. Grow your product.") balanced with flowing explanations.

## Brand 3: Cluely

### Core Voice Attributes

**1. Intellectually Provocative**

[ATTRIBUTE] Voice deliberately challenges conventional thinking and reframes "problems" as advantages.

Evidence:
- Manifesto positioning: "And yes, the world will call it cheating. But so was the calculator. So was spellcheck. So was Google."
- Headline framing: "Gain an unfair advantage in every call without anyone knowing"
- Challenges status quo: "You don't need help after the call is over. 28 notetakers help too late. Cluely helps in realtime."
- Philosophical stance: "The future won't reward effort. It'll reward leverage. So, start cheating. Because when everyone does, no one is."

**2. Direct and Unfiltered**

[ATTRIBUTE] Voice states uncomfortable truths bluntly without corporate softening.

Evidence:
- Problem articulation: "People talk less freely. People make fewer jokes. They turn every conversation into a monitored event. This kills sales calls, makes recruiting impossible, and makes you less money."
- Blunt headline: "Yep, you heard that right. Sales calls. Meetings. Negotiations. If there's a faster way to win — we'll take it."
- Direct benefit claim: "makes you the most prepared person on every call"
- Unvarnished positioning: "Completely undetectable", "Gain an unfair advantage"

**3. Opinionated Authority**

[ATTRIBUTE] Voice makes declarative statements about how the world works with confident certainty.

Evidence:
- Declarative truths: "In the world of tech twitter, a post that deserves to go viral will go viral, without exception, IF seen by at least a few thousand people."
- Labeled as fact: "FACT: With enough of an organic base (~10k followers), viral content will go viral."
- Sweeping claims: "Every time technology makes us smarter, the world panics. Then it adapts. Then it forgets. And suddenly, it's normal."
- Future predictions: "AI isn't just another tool — It will redefine how our world works."

**4. Rhythmic and Poetic**

[ATTRIBUTE] Voice uses short, punchy lines arranged for dramatic effect and rhythm.

Evidence:
- Staccato structure in manifesto:
  "We built Cluely so you never have to think alone again.
  It sees your screen. Hears your audio.
  Feeds you answers in real time.
  While others guess — you're already right."

- Parallel structure:
  "Why memorize facts, write code, research *anything* —
  when a model can do it in seconds?
  The best communicator, the best analyst, the best problem-solver —
  is now the one who knows how to ask the right question."

- Triplet repetition:
  "Then it adapts. Then it forgets. And suddenly, it's normal."

**5. Contrarian Educator**

[ATTRIBUTE] Voice teaches unconventional perspectives through thought leadership.

Evidence:
- Blog thesis: "This is perhaps the single most important truth I have learned during my entire time on this platform."
- Explains counterintuitive insights: "On X, follower count largely doesn't matter past 10k. Someone with 200k followers might average 2k views. This algo is very content-dependent."
- Product philosophy: "We need faster magic moments in larger, tangential, consumer markets."
- UX critique: "The first generation of AI meeting tools tried to be helpful, but they got the interaction model wrong."

- Reframes "problems" as advantages: "unfair advantage", "cheating" as positive
- No deference to establishment or politeness norms

**Directness: Straightforward → Subtle (95% toward straightforward)**

Evidence:
- Blunt headlines: "Gain an unfair advantage in every call without anyone knowing"
- Direct problem statements: "This kills sales calls, makes recruiting impossible, and makes you less money"

---

### Writing Principles

Medium sentences for explanation:
- "Cluely never joins your meetings, so there are no bots and no extra people on the guest list." (17 words)

- Used sparingly, not jargon-heavy

**Grammatical Patterns:**

Active voice dominates:
- "Cluely sees your screen. Hears your audio. Feeds you answers."
- "It kills sales calls", "makes you the most prepared person"

Second person address:
- "makes you the most prepared person", "your AI assistant"
- "While others guess — you're already right"

Third person for product:
- "Cluely never joins", "Cluely generates", "Cluely appears"

Statements over questions:
- Declarative statements dominate: "This is perhaps the single most important truth"
- Rhetorical questions minimal: "Why memorize facts... when a model can do it in seconds?"

Imperatives as challenge:
- "So, start cheating." (provocative command)
- Minimal direct commands otherwise

---

### Distinctive Voice Elements

**Storytelling Approach:**

Problem-solution narrative with philosophical framing

- Opens with relatable problem: "Join any corporate call today and there's a good chance a gray, faceless circle named 'Notetaker AI' will join right after you."
- Articulates emotional impact: "You pretend not to notice it, but it changes the way you behave."
- Positions solution as philosophical shift: "AI notetakers shouldn't sit in the meeting with you. They should work the same way pen and paper did: personally and unobtrusively."

Historical parallel structure:
- "But so was the calculator. So was spellcheck. So was Google. Every time technology makes us smarter, the world panics. Then it adapts. Then it forgets. And suddenly, it's normal."
- Creates permission structure for controversial positioning

**Humor & Personality:**

No humor detected. Personality expressed through:

Intellectual confidence:
- "This is perhaps the single most important truth I have learned" (bold claim)
- "FACT: With enough of an organic base (~10k followers), viral content will go viral." (certainty)

Contrarian stance:
- Embraces "cheating" label rather than defending against it
- "start cheating. Because when everyone does, no one is."

Bold honesty:
- "We need faster magic moments in larger, tangential, consumer markets." (transparent about business needs)
- "The truth is, it is actually quite hard to build software that feels truly magical to everyone."

Emotional connection strategy:
- Shared frustration: articulates pain points others feel but don't say ("This kills sales calls")
- Permission-giving: reframes "wrong" behavior as smart leverage
- Intellectual alignment: speaks to people who question conventional wisdom

**Visual Language:**

Metaphors used sparingly but powerfully:

Technology as progression:
- "Calculator", "spellcheck", "Google" (historical parallels)
- Implicit progression: pen and paper → AI notetaker

Surveillance imagery:
- "gray, faceless circle" (dehumanizing description of meeting bots)
- "third person standing in the corner of your living room, silently watching" (visceral metaphor)

Concrete over abstract:
- Physical descriptions: "translucent and hideable window", "doesn't join meetings"
- Specific outcomes: "kills sales calls, makes recruiting impossible, makes you less money"
- Precise numbers: "28 notetakers", "10k followers", "$10k/month SaaS"

---

Manifesto:
- Most philosophical and provocative

### Voice Signature

**What makes Cluely's voice unique:**

1. **Provocative honesty as positioning**: Directly calls the product "cheating" and "unfair advantage" instead of softening with euphemisms—owns the controversial framing.

2. **Philosophical manifesto structure**: Uses historical parallels (calculator, spellcheck, Google) to reframe current controversy as inevitable technological progression.

3. **Rhythmic, poetic cadence**: Short sentences arranged for dramatic effect create manifesto-like reading experience distinct from typical SaaS copy.

4. **Intellectual contrarianism**: Challenges conventional wisdom about AI, meetings, and product strategy with confident declarative statements.

5. **Problem articulation as differentiation**: Spends significant copy explaining what's wrong with competitors ("28 notetakers help too late") rather than just stating own benefits.

**Memorable characteristics:**
- "So, start cheating. Because when everyone does, no one is." (paradoxical permission)
- Triplet rhythm: "Then it adapts. Then it forgets. And suddenly, it's normal."
- Historical parallel structure: calculator → spellcheck → Google → AI
