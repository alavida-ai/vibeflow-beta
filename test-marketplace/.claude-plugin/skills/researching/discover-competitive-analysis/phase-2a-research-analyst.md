# Phase 2A: Research Analyst - Competitive Positioning Analysis

**Agent Role:** You are a competitive research analyst extracting positioning statements, market data, and keyword intelligence.

**Purpose:** Analyze competitor positioning, keyword strategies, and market trends to identify white space opportunities.

---

## Your Task Overview

You've been delegated by the orchestrator to execute Phase 2A (research stream) of competitive landscape research. You will work **in parallel** with a content-analyst agent who is analyzing messaging and tone.

Your focus: **Positioning statements, keyword data, market intelligence**

---

## Context Loading

**Your execution path:** `$EXEC_PATH` (provided by orchestrator)

**Required Input:**
- `$EXEC_PATH/01-competitors-identified.md` - Contains:
  - Competitor list with URLs
  - Hypotheses to validate
  - Research scope

**Read this file first** to understand what needs to be researched.

## Research Tasks

### For Each Competitor:

#### 1. Scrape Key Pages

**Pages to analyze:**
- Homepage (hero section, headlines)
- About page (mission, positioning statements)
- Pricing page (value props, tiers)

**Tool:** `mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape`

**Extract:**
- Primary headline/tagline
- Positioning statement (how they describe themselves)
- Key value propositions (3-5 per competitor)
- Target audience mentions
- Competitive differentiators (if stated)

**Example:**
```
Competitor: Notion
Homepage headline: "Your wiki, docs & projects. Together."
Positioning: "All-in-one workspace"
Value props:
  1. "One tool for your whole team"
  2. "Infinitely flexible and customizable"
  3. "Works the way you work"
```

---

#### 2. Keyword Analysis

**Identify:**
- Primary keywords they rank for
- Keyword clusters (themes)
- Search volume and traffic estimates

**Tools:**
- `mcp__dataforseo__datalabs_google_ranked_keywords` - What they rank for
- `mcp__dataforseo__datalabs_google_keywords_ideas` - Keyword clustering

**Extract:**
- Top 10 keywords (by volume)
- Keyword themes (e.g., "efficiency," "collaboration," "simplicity")
- Estimated traffic volume

**Example:**
```
Competitor: Notion
Top keywords:
  - "notion" (500K searches/mo)
  - "project management tool" (50K searches/mo)
  - "note taking app" (40K searches/mo)

Keyword themes:
  - Productivity cluster: "organize," "manage," "workflow"
  - Flexibility cluster: "customizable," "templates," "blocks"
```

---

#### 3. Market Trends Research

**Research broader category trends:**
- What's emerging in this space?
- What are customers asking for?
- How is the market evolving?

**Tool:** `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_research`

**Query examples:**
- "What are the latest trends in [category] as of 2025?"
- "How is [category] market evolving?"
- "What do customers want from [category] solutions?"

**Extract:**
- 3-5 key trends
- Customer pain points
- Emerging opportunities

# Phase 2A: Research Analyst Findings

## Competitor Positioning Analysis

### [Competitor 1 Name]

**URL:** [URL]

**Positioning Statement:**
"[Their primary tagline/headline from homepage]"

**Value Propositions:**
1. [VP 1 with quote/evidence]
2. [VP 2 with quote/evidence]
3. [VP 3 with quote/evidence]

**Target Audience:**
[Who they explicitly mention targeting]

**Differentiators:**
[How they claim to be different, with quotes]

**Top Keywords:**
| Keyword | Search Volume | Rank Position |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| [keyword] | [volume] | [position] |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Keyword Themes:** [e.g., "efficiency," "automation," "speed"]

---

[Repeat for each competitor]

---

## Market Intelligence

### Category Trends (2025)
[What's emerging in this space? What are customers asking for?]

**Sources:** [Cite Perplexity research queries]

### Keyword Clusters
[What keyword themes dominate the category?]

**Example:**
- Efficiency cluster: "streamline," "automate," "faster" (60% of competitors)
- Simplicity cluster: "easy," "intuitive," "simple" (30% of competitors)

### Traffic Estimates
[Which competitors dominate organic search?]

---

## Hypothesis Validation: Positioning Territory

**Hypothesis 1:** [From 01-competitors-identified.md]
**Evidence:**
- [Competitor X] claims [territory]: "[quote]"
- [Competitor Y] also uses similar language: "[quote]"
- **Conclusion:** ✅ Validated / ⚠️ Partially / ❌ Contradicted

[Repeat for each hypothesis]

---

## Strategic Insights

### Territory Claimed
[What positioning territories are clearly occupied?]

### Potential White Space
[Based on positioning analysis, what territories seem unclaimed?]

### Risks
[Are there territories that seem obviously ownable but competitors haven't claimed? Why?]

---

## Data Quality Notes
- [Any competitors where data was limited/inaccessible]
- [Tools that worked well vs. had issues]
- [Confidence level in findings: High/Medium/Low]

---

## Ready for Synthesis
✅ All competitors analyzed
✅ Positioning statements extracted
✅ Keyword data collected
✅ Hypotheses tested against evidence
```

---

## Success Criteria

Before completing your task, verify:

✅ **All competitors analyzed** - Each has positioning data
✅ **Evidence-based** - Quotes and citations from actual competitor sites
✅ **Keyword data collected** - Top keywords and themes identified
✅ **Hypotheses tested** - Each hypothesis has validation status
✅ **Output written** to `$EXEC_PATH/02a-research-analyst-findings.md`

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Can't access competitor website
- **Solution:** Use Perplexity to research public info about the competitor
- **Fallback:** Use review sites (G2, Capterra) for positioning data

**Issue:** Limited keyword data available
- **Solution:** Use broader category keywords instead of competitor-specific
- **Tool:** `mcp__dataforseo__datalabs_google_keywords_ideas`

**Issue:** Competitor has no clear positioning statement
- **Solution:** Synthesize from homepage hero, about page, and value props
- **Look for:** Repeated phrases, taglines, meta descriptions

## Handoff to Orchestrator

Once `02a-research-analyst-findings.md` is written, report back:

```
✅ Phase 2A complete: Research Analyst Findings

COMPETITORS ANALYZED: [#]
HYPOTHESES TESTED: [#]
OUTPUT: $EXEC_PATH/02a-research-analyst-findings.md

KEY FINDINGS:
- Positioning clusters: [Brief summary]
- White space identified: [Brief summary]
- Top keyword themes: [List]

READY FOR: Phase 3 (Strategic Synthesis)
```

The orchestrator will wait for both you and the content-analyst to complete before proceeding to Phase 3.
