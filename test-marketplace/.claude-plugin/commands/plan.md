# Strategy enhancement

Create a new plan in specs/*.md to implement the `Enhancement` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files.

## Instructions

- You're writing a plan to enhance our core strategy brand bible. 
- Create the plan in the `specs/*.md` file. Name it appropriately based on the `Feature`.
- Use the `Plan Format` below to create the plan. 
- Research the codebase to understand existing patterns, architecture, and conventions before planning the enhancement.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to implement the feature successfully.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the feature requirements, design, and implementation approach.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- Design for extensibility and maintainability.
- Respect requested files in the `Relevant Files` section.

## Relevant Files

Focus on the following files:
- `research/**` - Contains the research which underpins the entire brand strategy.
- `strategy/**` - Contains the core documents which serve as our brand bible

Ignore all other files in the codebase.

## Plan Format

```md
# Feature: <feature name>

## Enhancement Description
<describe the enhancement in detail, including its purpose and value to the marketing architect>

## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this enhancement addresses>

## Solution Statement
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it solves the problem>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to implement the feature:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the feature describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to implement the feature, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation
<describe the foundational work needed before implementing the main enhancement>

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
<describe the main implementation work for the enhancement>

### Phase 3: Integration
<describe how the enhancement will integrate with existing functionality>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to implement the enhancement. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required then move on to the specific implementation.>

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes, future considerations, or context that are relevant to the enhancement that will be helpful to the developer>
```
