# Build Messaging

You are facilitating a **messaging framework workshop** to develop 3-5 brand pillars (core themes) and supporting value propositions that ladder up to your positioning.

---

## Goals

By the end of this session, you should have:

1. **3-5 Brand Pillars** - Core themes that define what this brand talks about
2. **Value propositions** - Benefit statements for each pillar
3. **Pillar-to-content mapping** - How each pillar translates to content themes
4. **Supporting proof points** - Evidence/features that validate each pillar
5. **Validated messaging** - Confirmation that pillars support positioning and resonate with audience

---

## Prerequisites

**This command requires completed positioning. Verify these files exist:**
- `/strategy/core/positioning.md` - Your positioning statement
- `/strategy/core/narrative.md` - Your brand story
- `/research/customer-insights.md` - Customer language and needs
- `/research/competitive-landscape.md` - Market insights and keyword clusters

**Load all files** to inform messaging development.

---

## Your Approach

Brand pillars are **not just topics** - they are strategic themes that:
- Support your positioning
- Differentiate from competitors
- Resonate with customer needs
- Guide content creation
- Reflect founder beliefs

**Your role:**
1. **Propose pillars** based on research (don't start from scratch)
2. **Validate each pillar** against positioning, customer needs, competitive differentiation
3. **Develop supporting elements** for each pillar
4. **Map to content** so they're actionable

---

## Workshop Flow

### Phase 1: Pillar Identification

**Step 1: Review Strategic Foundation**

Remind the user of their positioning:
```
"Before we build messaging pillars, let's ground ourselves in your positioning:

POSITIONING: [one-sentence summary]
KEY DIFFERENTIATOR: [what makes you unique]
TARGET AUDIENCE: [primary persona]

Your messaging pillars should support this positioning and speak to
[persona's] needs around [core problem]."
```

**Step 2: Propose Candidate Pillars**

Based on your research, propose 5-7 candidate pillars. **Pull from:**
- Founder beliefs from interview
- Competitive white space from landscape analysis
- Customer pain points and aspirations from insights
- Keyword clusters from market research

**Present as:**
```
"Based on our research, here are candidate pillars that could work:

1. [Pillar Name]
   - Why: [Connection to positioning/research]
   - Differentiation: [How this is different from competitors]

2. [Pillar Name]
   - Why: [Connection to positioning/research]
   - Differentiation: [How this is different from competitors]

[Continue for 5-7 candidates]

Let's evaluate which 3-5 create the strongest messaging framework."
```

**Step 3: Collaborative Selection**

For each candidate pillar, test:
- **Supports positioning:** "Does this reinforce our [differentiator]?"
- **Resonates with audience:** "Does this address [persona's] needs?"
- **Differentiated:** "Do competitors talk about this? Can we own it?"
- **Sustainable:** "Can we create content around this for years?"

**Work with user to select 3-5 pillars.**

---

### Phase 2: Pillar Development

**For each selected pillar, develop:**

#### Core Message
One sentence that captures the essence of this pillar.

**Example:**
- Pillar: "Alignment Over Efficiency"
- Core Message: "Teams that share understanding outperform teams that just move fast."

#### Value Proposition
What benefit does this pillar promise to the customer?

**Use formula:** "So that [customer] can [benefit]"

**Example:**
- "We prioritize shared context over task speed, so that your team can work independently without constant check-ins."

#### Proof Points
What features, data, or evidence support this pillar?

**Examples:**
- Real-time visibility dashboards
- 67% reduction in status meetings (customer data)
- Async-first architecture

#### Content Themes
What types of content will this pillar generate?

**Examples:**
- Blog posts about alignment challenges
- Case studies showing alignment impact
- Social content about autonomy and trust

---

### Phase 3: Validation

**Engage persona-builder** to validate pillar resonance:
```
"persona-builder, please validate these [X] pillars against our primary persona:
[List pillars with core messages]

Check:
1. Do these address the persona's pain points?
2. Do these speak to their aspirations?
3. Is the language customer-centric or company-centric?
```

**Engage content-analyst** to validate differentiation:
```
"content-analyst, please check these pillars against competitor messaging:
[List pillars]

Questions:
1. Are competitors talking about these themes?
2. If yes, how can we angle them differently?
3. Which pillars are most differentiated?
```

**Refine based on agent feedback.**

---

### Phase 4: Pillar-to-Content Mapping

**For operational clarity, map each pillar to:**

**Platform suitability:**
- Which pillars work best on Twitter vs. LinkedIn vs. blog?
- Example: "Alignment Over Efficiency" â†’ LinkedIn thought leadership

**Content types:**
- Which pillars lend themselves to case studies, how-tos, opinion pieces?
- Example: "From Controller to Enabler" â†’ Customer transformation stories

**Keyword mapping:**
- Which keyword clusters from market research map to each pillar?
- Example: "Shared Context" â†’ "team alignment," "project visibility" keywords

**Priority/Balance:**
- Should all pillars get equal emphasis, or are some primary?
- Example: "Alignment" is primary (40%), others support (15% each)

## Usage Guidelines

**When creating content:**
1. Choose 1-2 pillars to emphasize per piece
2. Use pillar language consistently
3. Always connect back to positioning
4. Provide proof points when making claims
5. Use customer language from research

**When pillars evolve:**
- Review quarterly based on market feedback
- Add/remove only if positioning changes
- Keep language fresh but themes stable
```

## Key Principles

1. **Pillars support positioning** - They're not random topics, they ladder to strategy
2. **Differentiation matters** - If competitors talk about it the same way, refine the angle
3. **Customer language** - Use words from customer research, not internal jargon
4. **Actionable** - Each pillar should clearly map to content you can create
5. **Sustainable** - These pillars should last years, not months
6. **Validated** - Use agents to stress-test resonance and differentiation
